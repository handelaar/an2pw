Work in progress to convert Akoma Ntoso 3.0 sources from data.oireachtas.ie into publicwhip xml

If you find this before it's finished:  it is currently in a very alpha state indeed and is spitting limited output to the console.  Once all the element types used by the Irish parliament are completed, it'll move to outputting to a file handle (or to stdout) very quickly.

ETA: end-Jan 2022.  First version is designed to work only for KildareStreet.com; more functions to tweak output for your use case can be added after that.
