            <p eId="para_888">The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State. This survey replaced the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) from Q3 2017. The most recent data is for Q3 2018. </p>
            <p eId="para_889"> In relation to details of employment by county, the exact information requested by the Deputy is not available. The LFS is a sample survey and due to sample size limitations, it is not possible to produce reliable employment estimates at county level. They are, however, available for the 8 regional authorities or NUTS 3 regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> Table 1 shows the number of persons aged 15 years and over employed in each of the NUTS 3 Regions in Q3 2017 and Q3 2018 and the annual change in employment. </p>
            <p eId="para_891"> As Table 1 shows the overall stock of persons employed at given points in time, annual changes which are calculated using these stock figures measure the net increase or decrease in the number of jobs year-on-year. The number of new jobs created will, in general, be larger than this but they are offset in part by the number of jobs lost year-on-year. The LFS does not record whether a job is newly created.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">The pilot scheme to encourage people to return to living in town centres was launched on 11 October 2018. </p>
            <p eId="para_954"> A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, was established earlier this year to examine the issue, and a lot of consideration was given by the Group to the best approach to developing a model which would deliver on the objective of increasing town centre living. </p>
            <p eId="para_955"> The Steering Group noted that some schemes which have specifically attempted to focus on the renovation of vacant properties have had a disappointing take-up. It is clear that if we are to successfully encourage people to return to living in town centres, an integrated solution involving all aspects of town living and supporting infrastructure, needs to be considered. </p>
            <p eId="para_956"> The Steering Group therefore agreed that a pilot scheme, which takes a holistic approach to town centre living, should be developed in a small number of towns initially, with a view to a wider roll-out over time. This approach, which I approved, will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a small number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations. The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_957"> Six rural towns were invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme. They are:</p>
            <p eId="para_958"> 1. Boyle, Co Roscommon</p>
            <p eId="para_959"> 2. Callan, Co Kilkenny</p>
            <p eId="para_960"> 3. Ballinrobe, Co Mayo</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> 4. Banagher, Co Offaly</p>
            <p eId="para_962"> 5. Castleblayney, Co Monaghan</p>
            <p eId="para_963"> 6. Cappoquin, Co Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> Each of these towns will receive funding of up to €100,000 to engage with their communities and local businesses, and arrive at practical solutions that can be delivered to achieve the objective of increasing the number of people living in our rural towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> Representatives from each of the six Local Authorities involved in the pilot recently met with my Department to begin the process of developing the detailed schemes. It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns will lead to the development of more proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_967">The Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2017, published in July 2017 approved funding for a measure entitled access to services and amenities in rural Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_968"> At that time, it was envisaged that this measure would support older people and people with disabilities in accessing services, amenities and activities within the community. </p>
            <p eId="para_969"> It was also envisaged that the measure would support community based organisations which provide outreach services and support to people with limited mobility. </p>
            <p eId="para_970"> This measure did not progress as planned; however, to address this need subsequently a new CLAR measure was launched in August 2018. The CLAR measure has provided €1.4 million in funding for organisations that provide:</p>
            <p eId="para_971"> - Wheelchair accessible transport to assist those attending medical appointments or respite services.</p>
            <p eId="para_972"> - Transport to and from designated cancer treatment hospitals and centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> This CLAR measure has provided funding for 2 groups based in Galway. FORUM Connemara received almost €54,000 in funding for a 15 seater wheelchair accessible vehicle and Cancer Care West received €100,000 in funding for a 25 seater accessible bus. </p>
            <p eId="para_974"> Addressing this need through the CLAR measure has allowed me to use the voted Dormant Accounts moneys within the Department to address emerging needs elsewhere. In particular it has facilitated increased funding for the Senior Alerts programme so that demand can be meet right across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 62 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_978"> Pobal is a not for profit company which was originally established by Government in 1992 as Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd. Charitable status was granted to the company by the Revenue Commissioners on the 20th November 1996. In 2005 ADM was re-named Pobal. In accordance with Section 40 of the Charities Act, 2009, Pobal was entered onto the Register of Charitable Organisations on 16 October 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_979"> The basis for Pobal having charitable status is tied to the objects of the Company, which are specified in its Memorandum and Articles of Association. I am satisfied that Pobal is fully compliant with the relevant legislative requirements including those of the Charities Act, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_980"> Pobal is undertaking a review of its charitable status and in that regard has sought independent legal advice on the matter from Philip Lees and Associates. The review is at an advanced stage and a report will be presented to the Board of Pobal at their January meeting. The cost of the legal advice on the matter was approximately €10,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> My Department has been kept informed by Pobal of progress on the review through our standing corporate governance and oversight arrangements. I expect that Pobal will also be sharing the outcome of the review with my Department once it has been considered by its Board.</p>

            <p eId="para_983">The LEADER programme has made a huge contribution to supporting rural areas and rural communities for many years. As is the case with many EU-funded programmes, certain procedures must be followed to ensure transparency and accountability. However, I am committed to making the application process for LEADER in Ireland as efficient as possible for community groups. </p>
            <p eId="para_984"> My Department engages regularly with the Local Action Groups (LAGs) that deliver LEADER to identify potential areas for programme improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_985"> Following a Forum held with the LAGs in May of last year, I have implemented 31 improvements to streamline the LEADER programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> The impact of these improvements is clear to be seen in the level of applications and funding being approved under the LEADER programme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_987"> Overall, since the programme commenced, a total of 1,525 projects have now been approved for funding of over €50 million under LEADER. This compares with 592 projects approved at the end of 2017. A further 370 project applications, requesting an additional €23.4 million, are at various stages in the approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_988"> Project payments have also increased significantly in recent months as approved works are completed and claims are submitted. Over €10 million of project expenditure has been incurred in 2018, compared to just under €700,000 in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_989"> I expect that the progress now being made on the LEADER programme will continue as further projects are approved and payment claims are made. However, I will continue to examine ways to further improve the application and delivery process under LEADER, in consultation with stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce was established in July 2016 to examine broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits in Ireland and identify tangible actions to improve the quality of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_992"> The Taskforce Report was published in December 2016, and included 40 actions to alleviate barriers to mobile phone reception and broadband access. An Implementation Group was established in 2017 to oversee the delivery of the actions in the Taskforce’s report. Progress reports on the delivery of these actions are published on my Department's website on a quarterly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_993"> With regard to the specific issue of mobile phone blackspots, my officials, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, are actively engaged with Local Authorities and mobile phone operators to identify priority blackspots and take action to address this issue. </p>
            <p eId="para_994"> During 2017, officials of both Departments worked with a group of Local Authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. Building on this exercise, a call was issued to all Local Authorities in 2018 to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to improve telecommunications services. </p>
            <p eId="para_995"> To date, 17 Local Authorities have provided data on more than 200 blackspots, although it should be borne in mind that the number of blackspots is constantly changing as new telecommunications infrastructure is rolled out and upgraded. The blackspot information that the Department has received so far is providing data regarding poor coverage in specific rural areas and along national and regional roads. The Department is continuing to work with the telecommunications providers to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted at the areas most in need. </p>
            <p eId="para_996"> It is not envisaged that the data gathered through this exercise will be published due to the constantly changing nature of the information. However, through another action in the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce report, ComReg intends to publish a composite national coverage map by the end of the year. This will allow consumers to check which mobile phone operator can provide the best coverage in their area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1005"> There was an excellent response to the first call, with nearly 300 applications received. Applications for the Fund are currently being examined by the Project Advisory Board, made up of representatives from key Government Departments and external experts, which was established to oversee the assessment process. Category 1 "shovel ready" projects were prioritised in the assessment process and Category 2 projects - those which need development funding to become potential Category 1 applications in future calls - are currently being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010"> This allocation was made in coordination with the Irish Shows Association (ISA) and resulted in approximately 120 shows under the umbrella of the ISA in the Republic of Ireland receiving assistance of between €3,500 and €7,000, depending on the size of the show. </p>

            <p eId="para_1015">I launched the new Community Enhancement Programme in May of this year. I originally allocated €4.5 million to the programme. Based on positive feedback from communities around the country I recently allocated an additional €8 million to the programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> Under the original RAPID programme (which closed in 2011), specific geographical areas - known as RAPID areas - were designated to receive funding. Under the Community Enhancement Programme which has replaced it, funding is not ring-fenced for specific areas but is allocated to each Local Authority area taking account of its population and its relative deprivation level, using the Pobal Hasse deprivation index. </p>
            <p eId="para_1017"> The Local Community Development Committee in each area then allocates funding locally to community groups, in order to address disadvantage as identified in the Local Economic and Community Plan. This means that up-to-date data and local knowledge is used to direct funding to those most who need it most. It is a more effective, flexible and locally responsive approach to addressing disadvantage than ring-fencing geographical areas as under the original RAPID programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> The new approach was put in place following a review of the Communities Facilities Scheme and the re-cast RAPID programme that operated in 2017, and also takes into account a value-for-money review of the original RAPID programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1022">I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 61 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023"> My Department administers the Walks Scheme which facilitates the development and maintenance of many of Ireland’s walking trails. The scheme involves private land-holders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walks that cross their lands. Participant land-holders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024"> The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 private land-holders to maintain those trails.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025"> The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme. In line with this commitment, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from €2 million to 4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed next year. </p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> I will shortly be initiating a review of the operation of Walks Scheme which will inform decisions regarding the expansion of the scheme. In order to be in a position to bring new trails on to the scheme as soon as possible, I will also be inviting Local Development Companies and Local Authorities to submit expressions of interest in respect of trails that meet specific qualifying criteria, for consideration for inclusion in the scheme. </p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> I hope that this process will enable my Department to identify, in the coming weeks, the initial trails for inclusion in the expanded scheme, with additional walks to join the Scheme on an incremental basis. </p>

            <p eId="para_1029">The Programme for Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development both commit to progressing the Atlantic Economic Corridor initiative to support the development of the western part of the country, from Donegal to Kerry. </p>
            <p eId="para_1030"> The objective of the AEC project is to maximise the assets along the western seaboard and connect the economic hubs, clusters and catchments of the region to attract investment, support job creation and contribute to an improved quality of life for people in the region. The National Planning Framework recognises the contribution which the AEC initiative can make to supporting the regional growth objectives of the NPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031"> Minister Ring established the Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in March 2017 to oversee and progress the initiative. I now chair the Taskforce which meets every quarter, with the most recent meeting taking place yesterday, 10th December. </p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> Three subgroups have been established to support the work of the Taskforce, focusing on the issues of infrastructure, enterprise space and communications and marketing. Work programmes have been developed for each of these subgroups. </p>
            <p eId="para_1033"> My Department also provides co-funding for a dedicated AEC Officer in each of the Local Authorities along the Corridor. This AEC Officer network provides a resource to support the work of the AEC Taskforce, and to promote the AEC concept across the region as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034"> Over the last few weeks, projects based in the AEC area were approved for funding of €50 million from three Government funds - the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, and the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This investment, along with other infrastructural investments under the National Development Plan, will support the objectives of the AEC initiative to attract jobs and investment to the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1036">To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the TidyTowns Competition this year, I announced a grant scheme of €1.4 million at the end of 2017 to mark, in a small way, the efforts of TidyTowns committees all over the country who have given countless hours to make their communities better places in which to live. Over 900 committees availed of the grant. More than 40 different TidyTowns committees in County Kildare received funding totalling €76,000 in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037"> I was delighted to again be able to announce funding of €1.4 million in September this year for TidyTowns committees to assist them in preparing for the 2019 competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038"> Under the scheme, funding of between €1,000 and €4,000 is available to TidyTowns committees who have entered the competition in any of the last three years and I would encourage all eligible committees to apply for the funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039"> The allocation available to Tidy Towns committees in County Kildare under the 2018 scheme is €73,000 and represents 41 separate TidyTowns committees who are eligible to apply.</p>

This scheme provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged. The current iteration of the scheme runs from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2019 and the funding allocation provided to the Irish Deaf Society under the 36 month period of the scheme is €269,700. </p>
            <p eId="para_1101"> Furthermore, I can confirm that my Department is providing funds (under the Digital Innovation Programme), in the order of some 8,000, to the HSE Tipperary Town Gold Star Disability Awareness Project, which, working in partnership with a number of specialist agencies in the community, including DeafHear.ie and Tipperary County Council, aims to create and design an interactive learning tool to work with young people and members of the Deaf community in Tipperary. This is suitable for use with young people in post primary schools and anyone who has an interest in learning to communicate through Irish Sign Language. </p>
            <p eId="para_1102"> It would also be the intention to build on the post primary school base to have a basic app available for use in all civic and public offices across the county, for all community and voluntary services. This will ensure that when a client presents to any of these services that the staff have the resource to enable them to communicate, and with the same facility replicated across the county this will ensure consistency and increase access to services throughout the county. This project will involve the local authority, Transition Year students, students of Limerick Institute of Technology, DeafHear.ie, Tipperary Gold Star Disability Initiative and volunteers from the deaf community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103"> This project has the potential to significantly benefit the community, deaf and non-deaf alike. It also demonstrates a strong level of engagement across the community, demonstrating a collaborative approach to this important issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">My Department is at an advanced stage in developing Ireland’s first National Policy on Social Enterprise. </p>
            <p eId="para_1106"> The development of the policy is underpinned by a research and consultation exercise which was conducted by my Department in partnership with the Social Finance Foundation. The aim of this research was to better understand the social enterprise sector in Ireland and to identify the issues that need to be addressed to enable the sector to develop and grow. </p>
            <p eId="para_1107"> A Steering Group, which included practitioners from the social enterprise sector and key Government Departments, was established to oversee the research. As part of the research project, three consultation workshops were held in Dublin, Cork and Athlone, to obtain the views of stakeholders. An average of 40 people attended each workshop.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108"> In addition, an on-line survey was carried out which was open to all interested parties. A series of meetings was also held with relevant Government Departments and other stakeholders on specific thematic issues, and my officials also have visited and met with many individual social enterprises and social entrepreneurs. </p>
            <p eId="para_1109"> A draft of the Social Enterprise Policy will be published shortly for public consultation, with a view to the final policy document being published in the first quarter of 2019. </p>
            <p eId="para_1110"> My Department is also working closely with the wider Community and Voluntary sector to develop a new Implementation Plan for the Policy Framework for Local and Community Development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111"> Taken together, the two documents will support the full range of organisations that are providing services to communities or tackling social issues, whether through a social enterprise model or through more traditional community service delivery. </p>
            <p eId="para_1112"> Notwithstanding the timelines for the publication of the policy, my Department is already actively working to support the social enterprise sector. For example, my Department provides funding for social enterprises through the Dormant Accounts Fund, SICAP, LEADER and the CSP programmes. My Department has also recently taken a seat on the newly established EU Expert Group on Social Economy and Social Enterprises, to represent Ireland's interest at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">SICAP 2018 - 2022 is a €190m five year national programme that provides funding to tackle poverty and social exclusion. It is overseen by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) and delivered locally by Local Development Companies with expertise in delivering social inclusion interventions. </p>
            <p eId="para_1115"> The newly designed SICAP programme is a result of an independent national consultation process. It is more clearly defined than previous programmes and allows for greater flexibility and capacity to address local needs. The programme has to date exceeded its national targets, supporting 28,394 individuals and 2,253 community groups from a range of target groups including children and families, low income workers, long term unemployed, travellers, new communities, roma, and people living in disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116"> As our economy continues to improve, It is vital that we continue to focus on the needs of those people at most risk of being left behind. My Department is continuously seeking to make improvements to the effectiveness of SICAP to enable us to do this. Along with Pobal, we have commenced the development of a Distance Travelled Tool, to measure personal progression of individuals availing of supports under SICAP as they move closer to employment or education.</p>

            <p eId="para_1165">Project Ireland 2040 is the Government’s overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland. It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the next ten years, the National Development Plan 2018-2027, and the National Planning Framework which outlines the broader policy principles and priorities in planning for future population and economic growth to 2040. </p>
            <p eId="para_1166"> As part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government has provided an additional €1 billion for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund over the period 2019 to 2027. The Fund will provide investment to support suitable projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas which will deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040 and achieve sustainable economic and social development in these areas. </p>
            <p eId="para_1167"> The Fund's key criteria, which proposals for funding must demonstrate in order to receive support, are specifically designed to deliver on the strategic outcomes of Project Ireland 2040 - most notably strengthened rural economies and communities. The applications received under the first call from the Fund, which closed in September, are being assessed in accordance with the aforementioned strategic outcomes and key criteria and the first 18 successful projects which I announced last month will, I believe, deliver fully on the objectives of Project Ireland 2040. Further successful projects will be announced early in the New Year with a second call for applications under the Fund to follow later in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168"> In terms of the other capital funding schemes administered by my Department, such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the Community Enhancement Programme and CLÁR, the criteria underpinning funding decisions are tailored to the objectives of the relevant scheme, all of which are consistent with the strategic outcomes set out in Project Ireland 2040. </p>
            <p eId="para_1169"> While the LEADER Programme 2014-2020 is governed by regulations established by the European Union, the themes of the programme - Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation; Social Inclusion; and Rural Environment - are also in harmony with Project Ireland 2040 and will contribute to the achievement of the National Strategic Outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1175"> - Measure 3: Repair/upgrade and development of larger more strategic projects (grant of between €200,001 and €500,000).</p>
            <p eId="para_1176"> Since September last, I have announced the allocation of €1.8 million in respect of 128 projects under Measure 1, and over €8 million in respect of 18 projects under Measure 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177"> My officials are now assessing the applications received under Measure 2 and I hope to be in a position to announce the successful projects in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">The Revised Estimates for 2018 in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development sets out gross capital expenditure of €87.5 million. This is supplemented by €7.7 million capital which was carried forward from 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198"> As of the 7th December, €73.7 million of my Department's capital allocation has been spent; there remains €21.5 million in capital expenditure to be spent before the end of the year. This expenditure is detailed by programme in the table provided below. </p>
            <p eId="para_1199"> Close monitoring of expenditure is a matter of significant priority for my Department so as to ensure full use of our allocated resources, and that value for money is delivered in respect of our funding. </p>
            <p eId="para_1200"> I have already identified areas where some capital programmes are unlikely to spend their full allocation this year. For example, whilst LEADER activity is ramping up and a healthy pipeline of projects have been approved, the programme will not require its full allocation this year. </p>
            <p eId="para_1201"> I have been proactive in reallocating resources where possible. For example, I have already expanded the Community Enhancement Programme this year, increased investment in Libraries, and provided additional support to fund the Local Improvement Schemes. I have also supported the development of Coillte trails, Tidy Towns, Agricultural Shows and Men's Sheds Organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202"> The progress being made with regard to payments is clear. Almost €35 million in capital expenditure was paid out over October and November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203"> I can confirm that I anticipate full use of capital moneys, and have therefore not applied to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carryover capital money to 2019.

            <p eId="para_1255">The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256"> The CSO is not in a position to comment on how many people will benefit from the increase in the National Minimum Wage in 2019. However, data is available from the Labour Force Survey on the number of employees aged 15 years and over earning the National Minimum Wage or less.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257"> The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the official source of estimates of employment (ILO) in the State. This survey replaced the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) from Q3 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258"> As the LFS is a sample survey and due to sample size limitations, it is not possible to produce reliable estimates of the number of employees aged 15 years and over earning the National Minimum Wage or less at county level. They are, however, available for the 8 regional authorities or NUTS 3 regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259"> The table below shows for the first three quarters of 2018, the average number of employees aged 15 years and over earning the National Minimum Wage or less by NUTS 3 Regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1760">The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is an advisory body whose function is to represent economic and social interests in the Union’s decision-making process. </p>
            <p eId="para_1761"> The EESC has 350 members, who are drawn from economic and social interest groups in Europe. Members are nominated by national governments and appointed by the Council of the European Union for a renewable five year term of office.

            <p eId="para_1762"> The number of members is in proportion to the country’s population. Ireland has nine places on the EESC. Members are independent and perform their duties in the interest of all EU citizens. </p>
            <p eId="para_1763"> The EESC has a tripartite structure reflecting broad groups of members to facilitate the organisation of its work and its decision-making. Group I compromises representatives of employers, Group II compromises representatives of employees, and Group III compromises representatives of various interests. My Department invites nominations to the Committee and manages the expressions of interest. The Government approves nominations, which are forwarded to the Secretariat of the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764"> As a new term of EESC is not due to commence until October 2020, I am not in a position to comment on any future nomination procedure at this point in time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1768">My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769"> The White Paper on Defence provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more suitable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is under way in my Department at present, following the publication of a  Request for Proposals on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in May. The cost of the aircraft will only be known once the tender competition is concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770"> The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper  also provides for the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some €32 million for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet. It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771"> In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to €106 million for 2019, an increase of €29 million. The NDP provides for a total of €541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included.</p>

            <p eId="para_1773">Section 13(2) of the Army Pension Act 1923 provides that any compensation received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity awarded to an individual under the provisions of the Army Pensions Acts. The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration awards (compensation, pension, gratuity or allowance) made ‘on the double’ from any source for the same disablement and not the recovery of injury awards as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774"> In relation to the Deputy’s comments that the annual reduction in the disability pension now exceeds the amount of compensation awarded as a result of civil proceedings, the position is that the adjustment under section 13(2) was decided by the then Minister for Defence following consideration of all of the circumstances of the case, including the annuity value of the compensation awarded. The annuity value was obtained from an actuarial assessment and was based on various assumptions including the date the money was received and the life expectancy of the individual.</p>

            <p eId="para_1777">The outcome of the vote of 23 June 2016 in the UK will have implications across all aspects of the business of the European Union. While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland’s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778"> Brexit is a priority issue for this Government, and the Taoiseach, my cabinet colleagues and I have taken every opportunity to engage with EU partners and the UK to advance Ireland’s priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1790">I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99 and 102 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791"> The Government has committed to bringing the Defence Forces within the scope of the Working Time Directive. As I have previously informed the Dail, a Government Decision dated 18 November 2016 approved the drafting of the Heads of Bill to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. This will remove the blanket exclusions contained in Section 3 of the Act. Implementing the Working Time Directive is a complex process. To that end, work is under way in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality towards the progression of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792"> The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the Working Time Directive can be applied to the members of the Defence Forces. An audit of Defence Forces' activities was conducted and this audit encompassed the work of EOD personnel. Further consideration of implementation issues is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793"> For reasons of operational security, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the disposition and specifics relating to hours worked on Explosive Ordnance Disposal duties. Furthermore, as these duties are currently the subject of litigation in connection with the Working Time Directive I am similarly not in a position to comment on same.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794"> The Defence Vote contains sufficient funding to accommodate a strength of 9,500 personnel. As work on the implementation of the Working Time Directive is ongoing, costings on implementation are not yet available.</p>

The Commission has provided a paper on the values-related infringement procedures that it has taken to address concerns with the situation in Hungary.</p>

Ireland has previously made its concerns known in relation to issues surrounding the rule of law and recent legislation targeting non-governmental actors in Hungary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864"> I note the announcement on 3 December by the Central European University that it will be relocating to Vienna from Budapest from next January. Academic freedom is one of our fundamental values within the Union and it is a source of regret that an academic institute feels it has no other choice but to leave an EU Member State in order to continue its operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1869">On 10 December, the European Court of Justice gave its judgement that the UK can revoke its Article 50 notification, unilaterally, at any point up to its withdrawal from the Union. The Court made clear that it would have to be an unequivocal and unconditional decision, taken in accordance with the UK’s constitutional requirements. Were the UK to decide to revoke, the withdrawal procedure would be ended and the UK would remain an EU Member State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870"> Ultimately, any decision to revoke its Article 50 notification would be for the UK, and it would not be appropriate to comment on what would be an internal matter for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871"> The EU and UK have agreed a withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the framework for the future relationship. Our focus is on seeing this deal ratified and implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_1873">Ireland is committed to promoting freedom of thought, conscience and religion as well as the rights of persons belonging to minorities. In this regard, Ireland played a key role in the adoption by the European Union of guidelines on freedom of religion or belief during our Presidency in 2013. </p>
            <p eId="para_1874"> Ireland regularly condemns any violent attacks faced by Christians, irrespective of where they occur, or who the victims are. We strive to protect and promote human rights through our work at the EU, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly. </p>

            <p eId="para_1876"> At the same session of the Council, Ireland participated in the Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Mr. Ahmed Shaheed, welcoming the work he has undertaken to date and assuring him of Ireland’s continuing support for his mandate. </p>
            <p eId="para_1877"> Ireland also uses the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism of the Human Rights Council, to remind countries under review of their obligation to advance fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of religion or belief, under international human rights law.</p>

            <p eId="para_1879">I am aware of the organisation to which the Deputy refers. In February 2018, it sent a report to my Department entitled “Official India: On the Side of the Militants”.

            <p eId="para_1880"> Under Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.

            <p eId="para_1884">The Irish Government has been closely following reports regarding restrictions on freedom of religion or belief and expression, as well as the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities in China. </p>
            <p eId="para_1885"> The protection and promotion of universal human rights is one of the key values for Ireland and we take these reports very seriously and raise our concerns in an appropriate manner with our Chinese counterparts, in bilateral and multilateral contexts, and as an EU Member State. </p>
            <p eId="para_1886"> The subject of human rights were raised and discussed during political consultations held with China on 1 and 2 November last, with particular focus on our concerns regarding freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1887"> Ireland also participated in China’s recent Universal Periodic Review (UPR), which took place on 6 Nov. The UPR is the mechanism through which the United Nations Human Rights Council examines and addresses the human rights performance of its member states. In its input, Ireland called for China to respect freedom of religion and belief, with particular regard to the situation in Xinjiang, and called for China to grant access to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to all regions of the country, again with particular regard to the situation in Xinjiang.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888"> The EU has also raised its concerns regarding freedom of religion and belief on several occasions at bilateral and multilateral levels. During the 36th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 9-10 July 2018, the restrictions on Christians, Uighurs and Tibetans were discussed, and more broadly, the promotion of freedom of religion and belief, and the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889"> In June and September 2018, the EU delivered statements at the UN Human Rights Council raising the Union’s concerns regarding the deterioration of the human rights situation in China and calling for China to respect freedom of religion or belief and expression, as well as the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890"> The EU High Representative/ Vice-President mentioned this issue in a speech delivered at the European Parliament on 11 September 2018 and called on China to respect freedom of religion and belief in a speech to the European Parliament on 4 October 2018. The Spokesperson of the High Representative reiterated this concern in a statement on 26 October. Ireland fully supports the EU position, and actively contributes to its actions and statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891"> Through our ongoing contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing, Ireland will continue to raise the issue of human rights with China, along with our EU partners and other like-minded Member States.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade<recordedTime time="2018-12-11T00:11:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1896">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 to 116, inclusive, and 123 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_1897"> South Sudan continues to endure a terrible humanitarian crisis, primarily the consequence of conflict. I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1898"> The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1899"> On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan’s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900"> Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the Tánaiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the Tánaiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD’s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901"> Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902"> We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peace building. In 2018, this has included supporting partners’ meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women’s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes. </p>
            <p eId="para_1903"> As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The Tánaiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1904"> While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided €61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over €10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Trócaire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905"> As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than €90 million so far this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906"> With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2044"> An online platform for the renewal of adult passports was launched in March 2017 and to-date over 300,000 applications have been received through this channel. In November 2018 this facility was expanded to include children renewals as well as other adult renewal categories (for example applicants requiring a name change, an observation on their passport and those replacing a damaged passport.) As part of this expansion, a passport card is also now available for children. The passport card is valid for travel within the EU/EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland. In the interest of child protection and in order to ensure the highest level of integrity for the passport renewal process, the online renewal of a child’s passport will continue to require that a child’s identity is verified and that the consent of each of the child’s legal guardians is received before a passport is issued.</p>

            <p eId="para_2048">Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in June 2017, I have overseen and co-ordinated a sustained intensification of Brexit preparedness. As part of these efforts, the Government has organised “Getting Ireland Brexit Ready” public information events around Ireland to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness, and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place. </p>
            <p eId="para_2049"> These events brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments – the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050"> The Workshops also attracted significant domestic and international (in particular UK) media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland’s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit. </p>
            <p eId="para_2051"> Six Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop events have so far taken place in Cork on 5 October, Galway on 12 October, Monaghan on 19 October, Dublin on 25 October, Limerick on 23 November, and Letterkenny on 30 November. Having participated at each event, I am pleased to confirm that all workshops attracted a strong attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2052"> The Getting Ireland Brexit Ready campaign invited business throughout the country to either attend one of the six workshops, or to come online to the <i>dfa.ie/brexit</i> website, which has been visited over 26,000 times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053"> Attendance figures for each Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop were as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2054"> Cork: 420</p>
            <p eId="para_2055"> Galway: 220</p>
            <p eId="para_2056"> Monaghan: 420</p>

            <p eId="para_2059"> Letterkenny: 310</p>
            <p eId="para_2060"> The positive impact of the roadshows is reflected in an increase in interactions with the Brexit supports offered by State agencies. For example, Enterprise Ireland has recorded a 92% increase in Brexit Scorecard completions from September to October, as well as a 62% increase in interactions on its website. Similarly, Fáilte Ireland noted a 24% increase in views to their Brexit webpages subsequent to the October events, as well as an uptrend averaging 83% in the number of interactions on their Get Brexit Ready diagnostic tool.</p>
            <p eId="para_2061"> Other Brexit preparedness-related public information activities and events continue to be organised by State Agencies and Departments across Ireland and relevant details on these can be found at the new dedicated Brexit events page on the <i>dfa.ie/brexit</i> website.</p>

            <p eId="para_2067">Any Brexit scenario will mean considerable change and impact for Ireland and extensive and detailed Brexit preparedness and contingency work is being taken forward, co-ordinated by officials in my Department, working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach, across all Government Departments and Agencies. </p>
            <p eId="para_2068"> Our focus continues to be on ensuring an orderly UK withdrawal through ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council on 25 November and agreed with the British Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_2069"> However, it is only prudent for the Government to prepare for all scenarios. Departments continue to plan and prepare for both for the ‘central case’ scenario and a disorderly Brexit scenario and updated Departmental Action Plans have evolved and developed based on the changing situation. It is not possible to eliminate all risk but the Government is working at home and at EU level to mitigate damage to the greatest extent possible. We discussed next steps in this regard at Cabinet today.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070"> The underlying strength and resilience of our economy is critical in ensuring that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges that Brexit will bring and this has been a key factor in developing successive budgets including in Budget 2019. </p>
            <p eId="para_2071"> The Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to be put in place for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an East-West basis. The recruitment of an additional 1,000 staff for customs and SPS controls, in addition to ICT and infrastructure measures at our ports and airports has been sanctioned and implementation is underway. Various contingency measures, such as the rapid recruitment and redeployment of staff, and the use of temporary facilities, are under active planning for a disorderly Brexit scenario.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072"> Given that in a number of key areas for Ireland, the appropriate response and mitigation will be at the EU level, we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland, including through a series of expert level meetings with the Commission and the EU27 on key issues on a weekly basis until mid-January. </p>
            <p eId="para_2073"> The EU Commission acknowledged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication of 13 November. This communication also outlined some of the EU’s plans for a no deal scenario, including in the areas of financial services, citizens’ rights, air transport, road transport, and customs / SPS requirements. This has further informed our own domestic planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074"> Ireland is also working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and progress areas of key concern, including facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p>

            <p eId="para_2076">The EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement was concluded in 2006, and entered into force the following year. It has subsequently been renewed on two occasions. A Protocol implementing the fisheries agreement was also renewed on two occasions, and expired in July this year. </p>
            <p eId="para_2077"> Following a legal challenge, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment in Court case C-266/16 of 27 February 2018, where the Court determined that the existing fisheries agreement and protocol were not applicable to the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara. </p>
            <p eId="para_2078"> In April 2018, the Council of the European Union authorised the European Commission to begin negotiations with Morocco to amend the fisheries agreement and associated protocol in order to implement the Court’s judgment. Following those negotiations, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement, and a new Implementation Protocol were initialled in July 2018, and, last month, the Council of the European Union agreed to sign the Agreement and Protocol. For the proposed new agreement to enter into force and replace the current agreement, approval by the European Parliament will now be required. </p>
            <p eId="para_2079"> Ireland has carefully assessed the final negotiated outcome, and has received assurances that it fully respects both international law and the Court of Justice of the European Union’s judgment of 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080"> I must stress that the proposed new agreement, if adopted, would be without prejudice to the position of the EU on Western Sahara. In other words, there is nothing in the terms of the proposed agreement or its protocol which would imply EU recognition of Morocco’s sovereignty or sovereign rights over Western Sahara and the adjacent waters.</p>

Given that the production cost of a passport is the same, irrespective of validity, and given that any shortfall in revenue or additional costs would have to be met by the taxpayer, there are no plans to offer the option of a passport with a shorter period of validity at a reduced cost.</p>

            <p eId="para_2270">The Irish Government, together with the European Union, continues to view developments in Turkey with regard to freedom of media, human rights, rule of law and democracy, as well as the high volume of arrests and detentions of individuals such as those mentioned in the Deputy’s Question, with grave concern. </p>
            <p eId="para_2271"> The Conclusions on Enlargement adopted on 26 June last at the General Affairs Council stated that Turkey has been moving away from the EU and that accession negotiations have, therefore, come to a standstill. Concerns were expressed, including by Ireland, regarding backsliding on the rule of law and fundamental rights, and regarding measures targeting journalists, academics, members of political parties, parliamentarians, human rights defenders, social media users, and others exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms. Both the EU and the Government have repeatedly called on Turkey to address any failings in this area. </p>
            <p eId="para_2272"> In March this year, EU leaders met with President Erdoan and reiterated the importance of upholding the highest standards of democracy, while expressing concern that some of the methods used to restore order following the failed coup in 2016 had undermined fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Turkey. </p>
            <p eId="para_2273"> Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have frequent contact with officials in the Turkish Embassy, and have raised issues relating to the human rights situation in Turkey, and the large-scale arrests and detentions of individuals in the country, on a number of occasions throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274"> In August this year, I issued a statement welcoming the decision taken by the Turkish courts to release Mr. Taner Kýlýç, the Chair of Amnesty International Turkey. I expressed my concerns relating to this arrest and to the continued detention of other human-rights defenders, journalists and political activists since the attempted coup in July 2016. In the same statement, I called on the Turkish authorities to ensure that full due process is respected in the judicial system and that each detainee is granted a fair trial.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275"> Together with our European partners, we will continue to monitor government actions that undermine freedom of expression, democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights in Turkey, and to consider the implications of these actions for relations with Turkey.</p>

            <p eId="para_2277">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 allows for the re-distribution of assets that are to be transferred in a will or under the rules of intestacy in limited circumstances. Before receiving an asset to which a person is entitled, the person may disclaim or refuse the asset. However, a disclaiming beneficiary cannot choose who will then get the disclaimed asset which becomes part of the residue of the deceased person’s estate and is distributed accordingly. A recipient of the disclaimed and re-distributed asset is then treated as having received a taxable inheritance from the deceased person.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2278"> In contrast, a re-distribution of assets received by family members under a deed of family arrangement gives rise to two potential charges to capital acquisitions tax; i.e. </p>
            <p eId="para_2279"> 1. a potential inheritance tax charge for the original beneficiary on his or her inheritance from the deceased person, and</p>
            <p eId="para_2280"> 2. a potential gift tax charge for the beneficiary receiving the asset under the deed of family arrangement from the original beneficiary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2281"> As far as capital gains tax is concerned, deeds of family arrangements do not give rise to a charge to tax if certain conditions are met. Section 573 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that any variation made by deed of family arrangement in respect of the deceased person’s assets between family members within 2 years after the date of death (or such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may allow) is to be regarded as made by that person at the time of his or her death. </p>
            <p eId="para_2282"> It is worth noting that the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances in this State and in the U.K. is not directly comparable. The U.K. tax authorities apply a different basis of taxation whereby it is the value of the estate of the deceased person that is taxed and not the recipients of the assets as happens in this State. A further difference between the tax treatment in both jurisdictions is that the receipt of gifts is not generally taxable in the U.K. </p>
            <p eId="para_2283"> I have therefore no plans to make any changes to the current tax treatment for CAT or CGT in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2285">The Deputy is aware that the European Commission proposal for an interim Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 3% levy on the turnover of certain companies’ digital activities, has been debated among Member States at both a technical and political level for some months.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2286"> The Digital Services Tax proposal was included as an item for policy agreement at ECOFIN on 4 December, where Finance Ministers were asked to agree the scope of the proposal.  The debate was held in public session.   </p>
            <p eId="para_2287"> An agreement was not reached, with several Member States, including Ireland, expressing reservations about the proposal. An amended Franco-German proposal was tabled at ECOFIN which seeks to narrow the scope of the digital tax to online targeted advertising only. Subsequent to the discussion the Presidency proposed that Member States consider the Franco-German proposal in the coming months. </p>
            <p eId="para_2288"> Technical discussions will now commence on this proposal.  It will be for the Romanian Presidency to determine whether and when this proposal will next be discussed by Ministers. Ireland will of course engage constructively in this debate as we have throughout this process. </p>
            <p eId="para_2289"> I have always been clear that I fully recognise that further change is coming to the international tax environment. I remain convinced that global agreement at the OECD offers the most appropriate way for delivering these changes. Intensive work is underway at the OECD and it is expected that an update on this work will be published in mid 2019 with a view to reaching agreement before the end of 2020. </p>

            <p eId="para_2297">The Deputy will be aware that Revenue operates independently from Ministerial direction and matters relating to its internal structure are the responsibility of the Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298"> I have been advised by Revenue that it continually develops its structure to ensure optimum alignment of resources with the management of risk and the delivery of high-quality service to support voluntary and timely taxpayer compliance. For example, the Revenue Statement of Strategy for the period 2017-2019 indicates that Revenue will continue to ensure its structure accommodates and reflects changes in the customer base, the evolving national and international tax and customs environment, and the impact of significant changes for tax administration such as the PAYE Modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299"> In the last three years Revenue has reorganised its legislation divisions to set up an International Division, established  a stand-alone Customs Division, reorganised its Investigation and Prosecutions Division and established teams in Planning, ICT and the Revenue Solicitor’s Divisions outside Dublin.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2300"> The current phase of structural realignment involves moving from what was previously a single Large Cases Division and four geographically based Regions (Border Midland West Region, Dublin Region, East South-East Region and South West Region) to a new structure comprising of five new Divisions based on a nationally segmented customer base. </p>
            <p eId="para_2301"> The new national Divisions are Large Corporates Division, High Wealth Individuals Division, Medium Enterprises Division, Business Division and Personal Division. As part of Revenue’s workforce planning framework, the realignment includes additional resources being assigned to manage the risks in larger cases, including high wealth individuals. </p>
            <p eId="para_2302"> Revenue also advises me that it will continue to maximise the benefit of its geographic spread across the country and provide opportunities for diversity of roles, responsibilities and opportunities across the organisation. The realignment project will, over time, involve changes in roles and responsibilities for staff and I understand that Revenue continue to engage in a comprehensive programme of employee engagement to embed the changes throughout the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303"> I would like to commend Revenue for its proactive approach in aligning its resources in order to continue to meet the myriad of challenges it faces on both the national and international fronts.</p>

            <p eId="para_2305">I am advised by Revenue that in accordance with section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, where an employee is necessarily obliged to incur and defray out of the emoluments of the employment expenses of travelling in the performance of the duties of the employment, or otherwise to expend money wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of those duties, there may be deducted from the emoluments of the employee to be assessed to income tax the expenses so necessarily incurred and defrayed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306"> Arising from an employee’s entitlement to a tax deduction under that provision in respect of certain expenses, there exists a long-standing Revenue practice under which employers may reimburse tax-free to employees the expenses of travel (and subsistence relating to that travel), subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.  I am advised by Revenue that the conditions under which the reimbursement to employees of the expenses of travel and subsistence may generally be made without deduction of tax are as follows: </p>
            <p eId="para_2307"> (a) firstly, the employee must be temporarily away from his/her normal place of work in the performance of the duties of his/her employment;</p>

            <p eId="para_2310">Moreover, provided the employee bears the cost of all expenses<b>
							</b>of travel necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of his/her employment (and bears the cost of subsistence relating to such travel), Revenue will disregard for income tax purposes the reimbursement of expenses of travel and subsistence, where such reimbursement is made by way of:</p>
            <p eId="para_2311"> (a) a flat rate up to, but not exceeding, the prevailing Civil Service rates for travel and subsistence, or</p>
            <p eId="para_2312"> (b) a flat rate based on any other schedule of rates and related conditions of travel and subsistence, which do no more than reimburse the employee for actual expenditure necessarily incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313"> Revenue noted the comments of the Appeal Commissioner in the case mentioned above (Tax Appeals Commission Determination 20TACD2018). </p>
            <p eId="para_2314"> Revenue has published extensive guidance on the Tax Treatment of the Re-imbursement of Expenses of Travel and Subsistence to Office Holders and Employees – Part 05-01-06 of the Tax and Duty Manual refers – and, notwithstanding the Appeal Commissioner’s comments,  has no plans to alter its practice or published guidance on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_2426"> The Deputies will be aware that the administration of the tax code is a matter for Revenue. The Deputies will also be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as regards the confidentiality of a taxpayer’s affairs, Revenue does not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427"> The position in tax law is that where an employer provides free access to medical services to employees or provides refunds to employees in relation to medical services paid for by the employees, the employees are subject to tax on the services or refunds received. However, Revenue does not seek to apply benefit-in-kind where employees have free access to a general practitioner employed or retained by their employer. In addition, one medical check-up per year, and check-ups that are mandatory for work purposes, may also be provided. These exceptions are set out in published Revenue guidelines, and they apply as appropriate to all employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428"> Where free access to medical services is provided to retired employees by their former employer, these services are not taxable. If retired employees are reimbursed by their former employer for medical services, the amounts reimbursed are taxable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429"> The relevant tax legislation applies to all employers equally and there are no exceptions to the aforementioned rules for particular employers, employees or retired employees.  The manner in which any company provides services to its employees or retired employees is entirely a matter for that company to agree with their employees and retired employees.</p>

            <p eId="para_2458">Arising from information brought to my attention by Revenue concerning avoidance schemes, a number of amendments to the tax code were made in the Finance Act 2017. One of the amendments to which the Deputy refers was an amendment to section 135 TCA. This amendment nullified a cash extraction scheme whereby shareholders extracted distributable reserves from their corporate entities but avoided an income tax charge on the receipt of these funds. In essence, the scheme sought to substitute a capital gains tax charge for an income tax charge and where those individuals could also avail of retirement relief under the capital gains tax provisions in many instances no tax was paid on the receipt of these funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459"> The amendment passed by the Oireachtas only applies where an arrangement was entered into by a shareholder disposing of shares or securities in a company and the consideration is to be met directly or indirectly from the assets of that company. Revenue has published guidance which makes clear that bona-fide transactions are not affected as such transactions do not entail shareholders entering into arrangements to secure that the proceeds from any share sale are met from their company. </p>

Qualifying work is any repair, renovation or improvement works carried out on principal private residences or rental properties by tax compliant contractors.

            <p eId="para_2703">I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 157, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2704"> On 28 November, the Central Bank announced that it had been informed that Qudos Insurance A/S had entered into solvent liquidation. Qudos is authorised and regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and therefore the Central Bank had no role in this decision. It is understood that Qudos operated in Ireland on a freedom of services basis and that its products in this country were sold through Patrona Underwriting Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_2705"> On 4 December, Qudos published further information that it is no longer paying insurance claims. The Central Bank then issued a statement strongly recommending, based on the uncertainty around the payment of claims, that affected customers should contact their insurance broker to arrange alternative insurance cover. The Central Bank is actively monitoring developments and is liaising regularly with its Danish counterparts, the supervisory authorities of other affected member states and EIOPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2706"> It is understood that there are approximately 50,000 policyholders in Ireland that have been impacted by the developments with Qudos. Patrona Underwriting has issued a statement saying that policies remain valid and in force until their natural expiry date, however given the current Qudos position and in line with Central Bank recommendations they have provided brokers with options to replace all insurance covers with other providers at no extra cost to consumers. </p>
            <p eId="para_2707"> Early indications suggest that there are in the region of 1,400 claims outstanding in relation to Irish policyholders, but this is subject to confirmation. </p>
            <p eId="para_2708"> I understand that the Danish liquidators are currently continuing their review of the company with a view to determining its underlying financial position. Once this exercise is concluded they will be in a better position to determine whether the company can pay existing claims. It is expected that more information regarding this matter should be available within the next two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2709"> It should be noted that my officials have been in contact with the Danish Finance Ministry, who advise on the basis of information they have received from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that as the company is in solvent liquidation, claims will be met. However, the Ministry also indicated that if ultimately Qudos is placed into bankruptcy, and this happens after 1 January 2019, that the Danish Insurance Guarantee Scheme will not be liable to meet these claims due to a legislative change in May 2018. In such a situation claimants may instead be eligible for cover from the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), subject to its terms and conditions and the particular circumstances of the case. </p>
            <p eId="para_2710"> Regarding informing customers who are impacted by the failure of an insurance undertaking, if winding-up proceedings are initiated, in accordance Article 281 with Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC) “the competent authorities of the home Member State, the liquidator or any person appointed for that purpose by the competent authorities shall without delay individually inform by written notice each known creditor whose habitual residence, domicile or head office is situated in another Member State." I understand that this has happened and that the Central Bank has also instructed the Managing General Agent, Patrona underwriting to inform brokers and policyholders of the temporary stoppage in paying claims. </p>
            <p eId="para_2711"> The Central Bank has advised my Department that all relevant brokers have been contacted and the process of contacting policyholders is ongoing. It has also published information for policyholders on its website and this will be updated as more information becomes available. Furthermore, I understand that brokers are absorbing the administrative costs in arranging the replacement policies. </p>

            <p eId="para_2764"> Following approval by Government of the Report of the Flood Policy Review Group in September 2004, the Office of Public Works (OPW) commenced a project to collate from various sources, process and publish available information on past floods in Ireland. The data collated were published on the website www.floodmaps.ie in October 2006. Since then, the OPW has continued to collate information on floods that have occurred. This data collection has been undertaken directly or by consultants on behalf of the OPW, or via the local authorities and other sources. </p>
            <p eId="para_2765"> In May 2018, a new web-portal, www.floodinfo.ie, was launched to publish the Flood Risk Management Plans and the flood maps prepared through the National Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies. The past flood data up to 2014 have been migrated from the old "floodmaps" website to the new web-portal, where information on the past floods is available, including reports and photographs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766"> The flood data that are collated and published is limited to that which is reported to the OPW from a variety of sources (government, private and individuals) for inclusion as it becomes available. Some flood events may have occurred where data has not been collated and / or reported to the OPW, and hence would not be available. Similarly, only the data providing details on the floods can be published, which does not always include the degree of impact, such as the number of properties affected or the damages incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767"> The OPW is currently processing data on past floods that have occurred in recent years and these data will be uploaded to www.floodinfo.ie.</p>

Significant work has been undertaken by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to ensure that public procurement is accessible to all businesses, including SMEs. Specific measures to support SME participation include dividing larger tendering competitions into lots and setting proportionate eligibility requirements, for example in relation to turnover and insurance. Specific supports are provided by InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to assist SMEs in preparing for public tenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810"> Public bodies are also required to advertise all contracts for goods and services valued above €25,000 on the national eTenders portal (etenders.gov.ie).

Any supplier can respond to Requests for Tender (RFT) once they meet the criteria set out in the tender documentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3269">The demographic projections used to inform medium-term expenditure planning in the context of Budget 2019 are broadly based on the figures set out in the IGEES paper ‘Budgetary Impact of Changing Demographics 2017 – 2027.’ This paper sets out the likely additional costs over the next decade relating to increased demands in the areas of health, education and social protection. While Ireland currently has a relatively young demographic profile in comparison with other countries, as our population gets larger and older in the coming years there will be increased pressure on expenditure and the public finances. The size and structure of the population influences the demand for public services, particularly in the front-line areas mentioned above. </p>
            <p eId="para_3270"> Demographic projections are subject to consideration and updating in light of emerging data. Some demographic allocations were re-examined and updated as part of Spending Review 2018, for example in the area of Primary and Second Level Education.  Work is currently ongoing in selecting topics for Spending Review 2019. While the list of topics has not been finalised, it is likely that demographics will be an element of the Spending Review process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3274">The ongoing work regarding Equality Budgeting in Ireland follows the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to ‘develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights’. The Programme also includes a commitment to ‘ensure the institutional arrangements are in place to support equality and gender proofing within key government departments’. The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 contains a further commitment to ‘take measures to build capacity within the Civil and Public Service with regard to gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting’. </p>
            <p eId="para_3275">  A pilot initiative for Equality Budgeting was announced in Budget 2018 and as I announced in my Budget 2019 speech I am expanding Equality Budgeting to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is committed to working with other Departments and Agencies, and with experts and advocacy groups, in order to advance the Equality Budgeting initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3276"> Against this background, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group has now been established to assist in the further development and roll-out of Equality Budgeting in Ireland. The more specific role and objectives of the Group are:</p>
            <p eId="para_3277"> - to provide constructive, critical feedback on the Equality Budgeting initiative to date;</p>
            <p eId="para_3278"> - to provide expert guidance and informed insights on the future direction and areas of focus for Equality Budgeting, including in light of international experience, lessons from other policy areas and from academia;</p>
            <p eId="para_3279"> - to promote a coherent, cross-government approach to Equality Budgeting, to maximise equality impacts and avoid duplication of effort across various policy areas; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3280"> - to identify existing strengths of the Irish policy-making system which can be leveraged in support of Equality Budgeting, along with potential shortcomings that need to be addressed in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281"> The Expert Group will meet approximately every two to three months. Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will act as secretariat to the Group.

            <p eId="para_3284">English language schools in Ireland seeking to recruit non-EEA students are required to have the relevant education programmes listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP).  The ILEP, which is operated and maintained by the Department of Justice and Equality, is a list of education programmes considered to justify the granting of permission to non-EEA students to live and work in Ireland.  The regulations governing the operation of the ILEP specify that English language schools must be tax compliant and in good financial standing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285"> Irish immigration regulations oblige students in certain countries to pay fees to an English language school before they apply for a visa to allow them to come to Ireland to study.  These regulations stipulate that schools are obliged to safeguard such payments in a holding account and that they are obliged to return the payments within 20 working days in the case of a visa refusal.  I understand that the Department of Justice and Equality is investigating the specific case referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3286"> My Department is also taking steps to strengthen regulation of the English language sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 is currently before the Seanad.  The new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund. </p>
            <p eId="para_3287"> The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. </p>
            <p eId="para_3288"> Once fully implemented, providers must gain authorisation from QQI to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students. The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system. It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI.  </p>
            <p eId="para_3289"> The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider’s financial sustainability.  These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act. Providers will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. </p>
            <p eId="para_3290"> Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL). This fund will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it. The fund will be used to ‘teach out’ a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid.</p>

            <p eId="para_3292">There is an existing legislative framework in place to protect employment rights in the English language education sector.  This includes the Protection of Employment (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  There is also a comprehensive industrial relations machinery in place for dealing with workplace relations issues including collective bargaining issues at firm level and at sectoral level.  If individuals consider that their employment rights have been infringed under these Acts then it is open to them to take a case before the Workplace Relations Commission. </p>
            <p eId="para_3293"> The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is currently progressing a new piece of legislation through the Oireachtas which will further strengthen the regulatory framework in this area.

            <p eId="para_3298">My Department's policy is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs, including Autism (ASD), in mainstream school settings, unless such a placement would not be in the best interests of the child concerned, or the children with whom they will be educated. </p>
            <p eId="para_3299"> The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p>
            <p eId="para_3300"> Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. There are currently 4 special schools and 75 special classes in mainstream schools in Co. Kildare, including 6 Early Intervention classes, 46 ASD special classes at primary level and 15 ASD special classes at post primary level. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie. </p>
            <p eId="para_3301"> The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3302"> While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child’s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>
            <p eId="para_3303"> Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p>
            <p eId="para_3304"> My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_3305"> The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>
            <p eId="para_3306"> Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the Patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3307"> I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need in the Kildare area to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply. My Department has no role in making determinations in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3313"> The changes introduced took account of advice provided by the Teaching Council, which had engaged in a consultation process around a number of matters relating to entry to initial teacher education. Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberations. </p>
            <p eId="para_3314"> The changes also had regard to the Department’s policy “Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education – Implementation and Next Steps” (2015).</p>
            <p eId="para_3315"> Having relatively high minimum entry requirements in core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics is one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.  The 2011 Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and subsequent review identified the need to raise standards of achievement and included plans to raise the entry requirements in the core subjects over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316"> In recognition of the fact that not all applicants will meet the minimum entry requirements in Irish, English and Maths at the first attempt, there is no requirement that these minimum grades be achieved in one sitting of the Leaving Cert. Furthermore, there are a number of alternative qualifications that can take the place of the relevant Leaving Cert grade.  The list of alternative qualifications in the subject(s) concerned are outlined in the published Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2018 and available on my Department's website  (see www.education.ie). </p>
            <p eId="para_3317"> The Department has received a number of submissions regarding the changes which were introduced, which are currently under consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_3377">Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to some €1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to 18.7% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training. </p>
            <p eId="para_3378"> My Department's policy is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs, including Autism (ASD), in mainstream school settings, unless such a placement would not be in the best interests of the child concerned, or the children with whom they will be educated. </p>
            <p eId="para_3379"> The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3380"> Accordingly, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO (Special Educational Needs Organiser) to inform the planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3381"> Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382"> There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 139 are primary ASD classes and 41 are post primary ASD classes. The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3383"> The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3384"> While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child’s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>
            <p eId="para_3385"> Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p>
            <p eId="para_3386"> My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_3387"> The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>
            <p eId="para_3388"> Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the Patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3419"> NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>
            <p eId="para_3420"> This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_3447"> In relation to school admissions, parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed by the President on 18 July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449"> The Deputy will be aware that my Department announced that a new post-primary school will be established for the Drogheda &amp; Laytown area in Co Louth, to open in September 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_5030">In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5031"> As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  The 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5032"> A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5033"> In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5034"> The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>
            <p eId="para_5035"> As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000-place post-primary school was established in September 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown_D15 and Castleknock_D15 school planning areas as a regional solution. </p>
            <p eId="para_5036"> All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>
            <p eId="para_5037"> It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion. For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>

            <p eId="para_5040">I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5041"> On Monday 3 December 2018 my Department was informed of the closure of the school referred to by the Deputy. This school, which was a private English language school, is a member of MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), an association of English language schools. I understand that MEI representatives met with the school’s management and affected students on 3rd December 2018 and are continuing to liaise with all relevant parties. MEI are putting the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that students affected by the school's closure will be able to complete the course for which they have enrolled, or a similar course, at another MEI member school. My colleague Minister Mitchell O’Connor and I have also separately met with some of the affected teachers. </p>
            <p eId="para_5042"> The Deputy may be aware that legislation is currently being progressed through the Oireachtas which is intended to substantially strengthen regulation in the English language education sector. Committee Stage of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill was initiated on 5th December 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_5043"> This new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund. The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future. Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. </p>
            <p eId="para_5044"> Once fully implemented, providers must gain authorisation from QQI to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students. The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system. It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI. </p>
            <p eId="para_5045"> The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider’s financial sustainability and to evaluate a provider’s corporate fitness. These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act. All providers, including English language providers, will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. </p>
            <p eId="para_5046"> Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL). This fund will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it. The fund will be used to ‘teach out’ a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid. </p>
            <p eId="para_5047"> At Committee Stage reading of the Bill Minister Mitchell O’Connor announced her intention to appoint an experienced mediator to meet with bodies representing employers and employees in the English language education sector to explore the potential for a Registered Employment Agreement to be developed for workers in the English language sector. This will complement the provisions contained in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Amendment) Bill that are intended to strengthen QQI’s role as a regulator of quality in the English language training sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_5056">222. <b>Deputy Clare Daly</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> if the Office of Public Works advised his Department against the purchase of the Thornton Hall site on the basis that the site was unsuitable for the construction of a prison prior to the sale going ahead in 2005.

            <p eId="para_5057"> In February 2004, the Government gave approval for the then Minister for Justice and Equality to replace the facilities at the Mountjoy Prison complex with a new prison facility on a greenfield site. This development was to address the lack of capacity in the prison system and substantial operational challenges in the Mountjoy complex. On 11 February 2004 advertisements looking for suitable sites were published. In May 2004, a site selection committee was established to review potential sites. This selection committee, which included an OPW nominee, recommended the purchase of the site at Thornton Hall. The minutes of the committee's deliberations were subsequently published on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5058"> There is already extensive background information in the public domain on the Thornton Hall purchase - how it arose, the related prison accommodation issues and other relevant factors. In particular, the Deputy may recall the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General Annual Report 2005 which addressed this issue as well as the subsequent examination by the Public Accounts Committee in October 2006. The Comptroller &amp; Auditor General also addressed this issue as part of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services in 2014 (No. 9 Development of Prison Accommodation in Dublin) and the Public Accounts Committee subsequently examined this issue in November 2015. </p>
            <p eId="para_5059"> It is worth recalling, in summary, that due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available. In light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_5066"> It should be noted that section 31(7) of the Prisons Act 2007 provides that Governors, other prison officers and other persons employed in prisons shall, as far as reasonably practicable, comply with any request for information that the Inspector may make in the performance of her functions, which include the function of carrying out an investigation under subsection (2). In addition, the acting Director General of the Prison Service made clear that the Prison Service will co-operate fully with the investigation by the Inspector of Prisons.  The Inspector of Prisons will therefore have full access to relevant documentation and personnel in Prison Service Headquarters or elsewhere in the Prison Service in her investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5070">This detailed Supreme Court judgement raised a number of complex issues about the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts and their administration. It indicated that legislative change is required to facilitate the process of transferring prisoners from other States - in particular the UK - to Ireland. My Department is at present finalising a draft scheme of a short Bill to bring forward such changes.  This draft scheme will be brought to Government as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5071"> A further judgement in 2018 of the Court of Appeal has a bearing on those applications that were on hold as a result of the complex issues raised by the Supreme Court decision. The outcome is that the statutory scheme provided for in the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts must be implemented, and each application must be considered on its own merits under the existing legislation. All relevant applicants have been informed of this and will be further informed of any developments in their respective cases as they arise. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot prejudge the outcome of any such application</p>
            <p eId="para_5072">  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that there are currently 27 applications being processed. Each application is at a different stage of the application process. All require the collation of a number of detailed reports, e.g. Garda Reports and Probation Service Reports. Therefore it is not possible to give a specific time frame in which a decision can be made in any application, given the complex nature of the information required and the number of external agencies involved in the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5099">234. <b>Deputy Mattie McGrath</b> asked the <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b> if he will consider reviewing and amending the Garda vetting process to change to a situation in which those who are Garda vetted will receive a Garda vetting certificate which can be produced for each organisation rather than requiring an applicant to seek Garda vetting a number of times in which they are involved with a number of organisations; the reason Garda vetting cannot be used for more than one organisation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5100">The Deputy will appreciate that the primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the Garda National Vetting Bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults and it is carried out by An Garda Síochána primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 and is, as I am sure you will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5101"> The current system relating to Garda Vetting is delivered in a standard format to each organisation seeking Garda Vetting and this methodology is in line with good practice internationally. Vetting checks are conducted by the Vetting Bureau for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p>
            <p eId="para_5102"> Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5103"> Each relevant organisation develops its own policy in relation to the assessment of disclosures received from the Garda National Vetting Bureau.  Policies can vary between different organisations and in that regard, what is acceptable to one organisation may not be acceptable to another.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5104"> However, the Deputy will wish to know that the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_5105"> Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p>
            <p eId="para_5106"> In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda Vetting at present. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5107"> The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the eVetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received. Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the eVetting Tracking System, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online.</p>

My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5110"> I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the Vetting Bureau works to ensure that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure, prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation, can be facilitated without undue delay. </p>
            <p eId="para_5111"> All Garda vetting applications are processed on a first-come, first serve basis in chronological order from date of receipt. This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5112"> In respect of certain applications, it is necessary for the Vetting Bureau to conduct further enquiries, for example to confirm information provided by the applicant with external bodies. The time required to receive such information may be outside of the control of the Vetting Bureau. In such instances, processing times may be significantly longer than the general average.  </p>

            <p eId="para_5120">As the Deputy will be aware, whilst the Department of Justice and Equality have no role in east-west trade, I meet regularly with my counterparts in the UK Government as part of the ongoing engagement my Department has with the UK to support cooperation on justice-related issues. The exit of the UK from the EU provides the context for this ongoing engagement, but the issues discussed are broader subjects of shared interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_5121"> Since I became Minister in June 2017 I have had nine meetings with UK Ministers, as well as other interactions including telephone calls and letters.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122"> By way of example, in the last six months, in the margins of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) meeting in Dublin on 2 November 2018, I held a brief bilateral with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP, where I took the opportunity to express the Government’s position on ongoing Brexit issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_5124"> At the BIIGC meeting in London on 25 July 2018, I, along with the Tánaiste, met with Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington MP and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP. We discussed overall progress towards implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework, the security situation and stressed the need for bilateral co-operation to be maintained and, where possible, strengthened following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_5125"> On 25 July 2018 I had a bilateral meeting with the UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid MP, in London, where we discussed the evolving threats from organised crime and international terrorism and noted challenges arising from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. We also further asserted the commitment of both Governments to maintaining the Common Travel Area. </p>
            <p eId="para_5126"> In the margins of JHA Councils I met with Secretary of State for Justice David Gauke MP on 26 January 2018, Home Secretary Amber Rudd MP on 7 December 2017 and Minister of State for Immigration Brandon Lewis MP on 14 September 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_5127"> I can also inform the Deputy that I met with UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd MP, Justice Secretary David Lidington MP and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire MP, in London on 11 October 2017 where we discussed the close co-operation between Ireland and the UK on justice, immigration and security issues.  </p>

            <p eId="para_5183">The Reception and Integration Agency of my Department has been encountering significant upward pressure on its accommodation portfolio over the last year or so. This pressure has increased further in the last number of months with an increase in the numbers of persons claiming international protection and a growth in the percentage of protection applicants who require assistance with accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5184"> In order to ensure that the State can continue to provide accommodation for all protection applicants and continue to comply with the EU Reception Directive which was transposed into Irish law in June of this year, RIA has, since September, arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity. RIA is also increasing the capacity of the mainstream system by opening new centres in Kenmare, and Wicklow and in the very near future in Moville and Roosky.</p>
            <p eId="para_5185"> As a result of this increased demand, my Department has had to use  emergency beds on a temporary basis. Given that the accommodation is utilised on a temporary basis there is no set contract in place with each provider.</p>

            <p eId="para_5209"> The length of time taken to process an application can vary widely from case to case. Each case is addressed on the individual application. While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order. In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all the required documentation and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions. For example, in the cases of serious injury to the victim, it can take considerable amount of time before the treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis. It is also often necessary to await Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation before a final decision can be made in a case. By their nature, such investigations can be lengthy and complex.</p>

            <p eId="para_5217">I am happy to confirm that the Government’s roll-out of the reform of the Irish legal services sector to which the Deputy has referred has been taking place since the enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. The Act is the vehicle for the relevant reforms recommended by the Competition Authority in 2006 as undertaken by the Government under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme. These include the introduction of a new and more consumer-friendly legal costs transparency regime, the setting out of Legal Costs Principles and the modernising transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators who will maintain a public register of their legal costs determinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5218"> They also include the introduction of an independent complaints and professional conduct regime for both solicitors and barristers including the establishment and appointment of an independent Legal Practitioners’ Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the new Authority. Both the legal costs and the public complaints regimes, for which extensive preparations are ongoing, are due to come into operation during Quarter 2 of 2019. The regulated introduction of new legal services models in the guise of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is also due in Quarter 1 of 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_5219"> The key driver for much of this programme of structural reform is the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which was established, along the lines recommended by the Competition Authority, on 1 October 2016 and held its first meeting on 26 October 2016. The Authority has eleven members including a lay majority and a lay Chair, Dr. Don Thornhill, and continues to roll out its functions under its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty. Members of the Authority are nominated by ten prescribed nominating bodies who represent a balance of interests between the legal professions and those consumers, both private and enterprise, who avail of their services. The Authority is, under the 2015 Act, independent in the performance of its functions and appointments to it have to be approved by a motion of each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5220"> In its first year of operations to the end of 2017, the Authority produced five mandatory reports on new legal services options which included public consultations within deadlines set under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. It has also submitted its Annual Report for 2017 and recently produced a review of legal professional education. The Deputy will wish to be aware that I have laid these, along with the other reports to which I have referred, before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the required manner. The Authority will also soon be submitting its first statutory review of the operation of the 2015 Act directly to each House.</p>
            <p eId="para_5221"> The Authority's forthcoming actions have been set out in its first Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which I laid before the Houses on 1 May 2018. The Plan sets out indicative timelines for the roll-out of the Authority's functions during that period. This will be supported in each instance with the commencement, by me as Minister, of the relevant provisions concerned. The Authority has its own website on <i>www.lsra.ie</i> where its reports, minutes of meetings, Strategic Plan and other useful information are also publicly available.</p>

            <p eId="para_5223">As the Deputy is aware the Thornton Hall site was purchased in 2005 with the intention of constructing a large scale prison campus to replace the 19th century complex at Mountjoy Prison which the then Government planned to sell to fund the development. Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed. In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation. In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.</p>
            <p eId="para_5224"> In the meantime, the Thornton Hall site which is fully serviced and adjacent to Dublin airport remains in my Department’s ownership and in recent years a working group, which included representatives from the OPW, considered future use options for the site. This included discussions with Fingal County Council. More recently, the site has also been flagged to the Department of Housing and Local Government, and to the Land Development Agency. As such, the site will be considered both in the context of broader State requirements for land assets and future requirements in relation to detention of prisoners.</p>

            <p eId="para_5235"> The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is responsible for progressing the commitments under the Inclusion Strategy that relate to the extension of the ISL remote interpretation service, the  increase in the number of interpreters, the establishment of a quality-assurance and registration scheme and the provision of on-going professional training and development for interpreters. Work has commenced on the implementation of this programme, completion of which is expected by 2021. DEASP will be reporting periodically on its progress in this regard to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, (which comprises the Interdepartmental Committee, the Disability Stakeholders Group and the National Disability Authority), and at local level through its Departmental Consultative Committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_5498"> As the Deputy will be aware, Phase One of this rollout is completed, with Divisional Units established in three areas - DMR West, Cork City, and Louth Division.</p>

            <p eId="para_5506">As the Deputy will be aware, this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_5507"> As part of the Garda approach special targeted patrols are carried out with the assistance of Garda National Support Services against criminals who are committing crime inter-regionally. This includes a focus on the use of motorways by criminal gangs so as to disrupt and arrest those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5508"> The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime – under Operation Thor - has led to (as of 2 November 2018) over 168,636 targeted checkpoints and 243,277 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This has produced in the region of 8,837 arrests and 10,143 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_5509"> Gardaí continue to pursue a range of measures to support elderly and more vulnerable people in the community, working closely with Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_5510"> At the Ploughing Championships in September, I announced details of the 2018 Text Alert Rebate Scheme which will be available to over 1,000 local groups registered under the Garda Text Alert Scheme. My Department will be making in the region of €150,000 available to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5511"> Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop, which was launched by the Gardaí and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA). Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID and then registered on a nationwide database. The clearly visible serial number should act as a deterrent to criminals. A further impediment for criminals is that the details and serial numbers of stolen equipment can be viewed by would-be buyers on-line at www.theftstop.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5512"> Other partnership initiatives with the IFA and Crimestoppers have included a reward fund to encourage reports to assist Gardaí in identifying those involved in livestock theft. Anyone with information about livestock theft may use the Crimestoppers confidential number 1800 25 00 25 to make a report if they so wish, or contact Gardaí directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5513"> Furthermore, new legislation has been put in place to target repeat burglary offenders and the Government is determined that there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Gardaí are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities in various parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5514"> Underpinning the strong policing action now being taken against burglars and criminal gangs is the Government’s commitment to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme. I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this increase in resources with an increase of over €100 million on the 2018 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515"> Undoubtedly, rural communities will benefit from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_5517">During the course of 2018, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has been engaged in the development of draft Irish Standard I.S. 820 - Non-domestic gas installations. A public consultation was held earlier this year as part of that development process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5518"> Standard I.S. 820 included a proposal to recommend installation of carbon monoxide detection in sleeping areas of commercial buildings. This issue was the subject of comments submitted as part of the public consultation process. Upon review of those comments, the technical experts and regulators considered that this specific matter required separate consideration and assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519"> As a result, the NSAI Gas Technical Standards Committee, at its recent meeting in November 2018, agreed to exclude this recommendation from I.S. 820. It also agreed that the establishment of a new working group, dedicated to this topic, would be more appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520"> This group will be formed early in 2019 and will aim to have stakeholder participation from other sectors of fuel types, such as gas, oil and solid fuels. One of the group’s initial tasks will be to seek NSAI Board approval for the work and set timelines for output delivery.</p>

            <p eId="para_5526">Receivership is a remedy that derives from courts of equity. The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles. Receivers are appointed under a relevant security e.g. a mortgage or a charge which contains the contractual terms in relation to their appointment and their powers under the instrument. Depending on the circumstances of the case, courts may also, on application from a secured creditor, exercise their discretionary powers to appoint a receiver. Receivers can also be appointed under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5527"> Section 437 of the Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on the receiver of the property of a company and is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures. However, section 437(4) makes clear that these powers are limited by any provision in the instrument under which the receiver was appointed, again underlying the essentially contractual nature of receivership.</p>
            <p eId="para_5528"> A receiver will have the right to secure and sell the property the subject of the debenture so that the debt to the lender can be repaid. However, section 437(5) of the Act provides that the conferral of powers in relation to the property of a company does not affect any rights in relation to that property of any other person.</p>
            <p eId="para_5529"> When selling the property, a receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 of the Companies Act 2014 which provides that:</p>
            <p eId="para_5530">(i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and</p>
            <p eId="para_5531">(ii) the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days’ notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_5532"> These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty “to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable”. Breach of a receiver’s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_5533"> It should be noted that receivers of the property of a company also have a duty under Part 8 of the Companies Act 2014 to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>

            <p eId="para_5536"> The Employment Permits section is experiencing high levels of demand for employment permits this year and this has contributed to increased processing times for applications.  At end November 2018, 15,550 applications had been received, a 27% increase on the same time last year.

            <p eId="para_5542">On 14 September 2016, the EU Commission published a package of copyright reform proposals as part of its Digital Single Market strategy. This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the “Copyright Directive”). </p>
            <p eId="para_5543"> The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens. Among the Directive’s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the “value gap”, whereby rightsholders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>
            <p eId="para_5544"> Officials of my Department have actively engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal. On 25 May 2018, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at Coreper and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate from the Council to commence negotiations with the European Parliament. The Parliament voted to endorse its approach at its plenary session on 12 September 2018. </p>
            <p eId="para_5545"> Trilogue negotiations between the European Council, the European Parliament, and the European Commission commenced in October and good progress has been made in towards crafting a compromise suitable for all three institutions of the European Union. </p>
            <p eId="para_5546"> Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and the Irish position has been developed on the basis of detailed examination but also significant engagement with the wide range of stakeholders affected across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level. I fully support this proposal which is vitally important to both the digital economy and to rightholders seeking greater protection of their works in the digital age. Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rightsholders, and citizens. </p>
            <p eId="para_5547"> Once a compromise approach has been agreed at trilogues it will be put to the European Parliament for a vote. If this final vote is successful, Ireland will then have two years to transpose the Copyright Directive into its national legislation. This transposition process will include extensive consultation with our stakeholders to ensure that Ireland has the most appropriate and suitable legislation that meets the needs of our citizens in the modern digital age.</p>

            <p eId="para_5549">IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all counties of Ireland to its client base. It is important to remember, however, that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA client companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5550"> The IDA, for its part, is actively promoting Meath as a location for investment to its prospective and existing clients. County Meath has hosted five IDA site visits so far this year, compared to three site visits for 2017. The IDA also has a number of locations available for investment in Meath which are being marketed to its clients. These include lands at the Business &amp; Technology Parks in Navan and at Donore Road on the Meath side of Drogheda.  I am hopeful that more investors can be encouraged to locate in Meath and thereby contribute even more to job creation in the County.</p>
            <p eId="para_5551"> Meath is already home to a number of overseas companies who have shown a significant level of commitment the County, with companies such as International Fund Services (IFS) Limited, Arcroyal and Alltech continuing to perform well.  In April of this year, PCI Pharma Services announced the launch of its new facility in Stamullen which will create 50 new jobs over the next five years.</p>

            <p eId="para_5666">The Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) represents part of my Department’s commitment to stimulating economic growth throughout the regions. The overall aim of the REDF is to support every region to build on its unique strengths and ultimately create sustainable jobs. Collaboration is at its core – among the public and private sectors, within and across regions.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5667"> The REDF support the development of initiatives that help to strengthen the ability of the regions in achieving high impact on economic development, job creation and enterprise development at a regional level. </p>
            <p eId="para_5668"> The Fund has four streams:</p>
            <p eId="para_5669">- Stream One to support major regional, multi-regional or national sectorial initiative grants of €2m up to €5m per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These initiatives should be focussed on achieving defined enterprise development outputs and impacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5670">- Stream Two to support significant county, regional or multi-regional sectorial and or enterprise initiative grants of €250k up to €2m per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These projects should be focussed on delivery of defined enterprise development outputs and impacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">- Stream Three for local and community enterprise initiative grants of €50k up to €250k per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These projects should be focussed at a local, county or regional initiative that have defined metrics for enterprise development in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">- Stream Four to support significant Industry Clustering initiatives with grants of €50k up to €250k per project in funding towards current costs.  These projects should support industry-led groups to maximise the benefits of collaborative opportunities where the results of the activity will have some identifiable and measurable impact on their business.</p>
            <p eId="para_5673">  Stream four in particular seeks to support Industry Clusters either already established or newly formed and designed to stimulate innovative activity through mutual interests such as promotional activities, sharing of facilities and exchange of knowledge and expertise and by contributing effectively to knowledge transfer, networking, information dissemination and collaboration among the undertakings and other organisations and relevant stakeholders in the cluster. This allows for smaller industry-connected enterprises to join such consortia in the application for funding through the REDF scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5678">As the Deputy will be aware Brexit is a priority issue for this Government. The Taoiseach, Tánaiste, my cabinet colleagues and I have taken every opportunity to engage with EU partners and the UK to advance Ireland’s priorities. </p>
            <p eId="para_5679">  Of course negotiations on both the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship, both of which were endorsed by the European Council on 25 November, were conducted on behalf of the EU27 by the EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Commission's Article 50 Taskforce. </p>

            <p eId="para_5687"> At various EU Council meetings this year I have met with various EU counterparts, including UK colleagues, both formally and informally. This included meetings with the UK Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Mr Greg Hands MP and, on two occasions with the U.K. Minister of State for Trade Policy, Mr George Hollingbery MP. Maintaining the strength of the Irish-UK trading relationship was a key focus of these discussions. </p>

            <p eId="para_5697">  The Deputy will be aware that the Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to support continued trade in the context of Brexit in areas of staffing, ICT and in terms of infrastructure that could be needed at our ports and airports. </p>

There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act.

            <p eId="para_6215">The 2012 National Carers’ Strategy is a cross-departmental strategy that sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government Departments and agencies for carers. The Strategy is to be implemented on a cost neutral basis. Each relevant Department is responsible for the implementation of their actions and the Department of Health co-ordinates a progress report on overall implementation which is produced on a periodic basis over the lifetime of the Strategy and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The Strategy contains actions to implement four national goals encompassing a recognition of the value and contribution made by family carers, a need to support carers to manage their own health and well-being, providing adequate information, training, supports and services, and the empowering of carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p>
            <p eId="para_6216"> As part of the National Carers' Strategy, the Department of Health is committed to the periodic publication of progress reports, highlighting work carried out by relevant Government departments and agencies. The fifth progress report, capturing actions which took place in 2017, was published on the Department of Health's website in August 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_6217"> The Department of Health is engaging with other Departments at present with a view to the development of a revised Action Plan for the further implementation of the Strategy. Meetings have been held between the Department of Health and a number of other departments and agencies to identify additional actions which can be carried out. A stakeholder consultation on the draft Department of Health/HSE health-related proposals was undertaken at the Annual Carers Forum organised by the Department of Employment and Social Protection in November. Family Carers Ireland, the main carer representative organisation, has submitted a revised set of proposed actions for various Government Departments which will be considered in consultation with other Government Departments and the Department of the Taoiseach over the next few months with a view to agreeing a revised action plan in 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_6242">An alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process was put in place by the Courts in late 2015. This means that any person seeking compensation on foot of being fitted with the recalled DePuy ASR hip resurfacing device or DePuy ASR XL total hip replacement implants must now pursue their case through this process in the first instance. Details of how to access this process are available at <i>hipadr.ie</i>. I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that if a settlement is not agreed through this process, the claimant can then pursue their claim through the courts. A solicitor is not required to apply to the ADR scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6328">As the Deputy will be aware, in June 2018, I appointed Graham Knowles, Chairperson of the University of Limerick Hospital Group, to chair a Working Group to carry out an independent expert review of delayed discharges. Delayed discharges result in longer lengths of stay for patients, impact on patient flow and contribute to congestion within the hospital system, including in our Emergency Departments. The purpose of the review was to identify the factors which result in delayed discharges and to identify short to medium term changes to reduce the overall number of delayed discharges in the acute hospital system. I received the Working Group's report in November. </p>
            <p eId="para_6329"> The report made nine recommendations, including the development of a national policy to provide for a more consistent approach to recording delayed discharges, strengthening data collection, standardising definitions and ensuring consistent discharge guidelines. It also recommended a more integrated care approach between hospitals and community services, early discharge pathways to prevent admissions and enable assessment of care needs in the patient’s home or alternative care settings and a public health campaign to raise awareness that patients who are discharged without delay have better outcomes. </p>
            <p eId="para_6330"> It is my intention to advance the recommendations of the review in 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_6346"> I take it that the Deputy is referring to the on-going preparation for the move to HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism for CervicalCheck.</p>
            <p eId="para_6347"> As the Deputy will be aware, switching to HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism will require a reconfiguration of laboratory services.

            <p eId="para_6348"> Funding to implement the switch to HPV screening has been allocated in Budget 2019, along with funding to implement the recommendations of Dr Gabriel Scally’s inquiry in to the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, illustrating the Government’s commitment to these essential projects. </p>

            <p eId="para_6351">The Government approved the general scheme of the Patient Safety Bill on 5 July 2018. The Bill provides the legislative framework for a number of important patient safety issues, including providing in legislation for mandatory open disclosure of “serious patient safety incidents” and the notification of such incidents to the appropriate regulatory body and the State Claims Agency. The Bill also empowers the Minister for Health to issue guidance with respect to the undertaking of clinical audit against explicit clinical standards on a national basis, as well as the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority’s remit to private hospitals. </p>
            <p eId="para_6352"> With respect to the mandatory open disclosure of “serious patient safety incidents”, it is intended that the Bill will provide assurance with regard to transparency of reporting to patients and/or their families, and act as a platform for the dissemination of learning across the whole health system through the requirement for mandatory external reporting by health service providers to the appropriate authority. </p>
            <p eId="para_6353"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the Patient Safety Bill on 26 September 2018, while the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government is working with my officials in drafting of the Patient Safety Bill.

It is expected that the final draft of the Bill will be brought to Government for approval early next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_6355">The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 which specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>
            <p eId="para_6356"> Before any medicinal product can be assessed for reimbursement by the HSE, it is required to have been granted a marketing authorisation by either the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in accordance with the criteria under the 2013 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_6357"> In that respect, Pembrolizumab has been granted marketing authorisation in Ireland and the EU for a number of indications and is included on the HSE reimbursement list for some of those indications. Furthermore, Pembrolizumab is being assessed by the HSE using the criteria in the 2013 Act for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation. </p>
            <p eId="para_6358"> However, Pembrolizumab has not been granted a marketing authorisation by either the EMA or by HPRA for the treatment of cervical cancer and accordingly, in accordance with the 2013 Act, it cannot be assessed by HSE for reimbursement for cervical cancer, using the standard criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_6359"> The Deputy will be aware that a Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck. As part of this package, all out of pocket medical costs incurred by the women affected will be met to the extent that they are not already covered either under existing public schemes or any private health insurance policy that an individual might hold. This commitment included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician. Although not specifically referenced, Pembrolizumab would be encompassed under this aspect of the support package. </p>
            <p eId="para_6360"> I am aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy and other public representatives regarding the question of providing Pembrolizumab to other cervical cancer patients on the same basis as encompassed by the Government decision of 11 May 2018. In the light of these concerns, I have requested the HSE to examine ways in which other women with cervical cancer could be afforded access to Pembrolizumab if prescribed by their treating clinician. </p>
            <p eId="para_6361"> This is not a straightforward matter and there is a range of issues to be addressed in pursing such an approach. These include the question of supply of the product and any terms (including financial ones) under which it might be supplied, the cooperation of the clinical community and the development of appropriate governance and management arrangements, the method of selection of patients suitable to commence treatment and the criteria that would govern clinical decisions in respect of continuation or discontinuation of treatment. Any proposals must place patient safety as a priority, given that this is not a licensed medicine for the treatment of cervical cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_6362"> I too am anxious to see early progress in this matter and I have asked the HSE to revert to me as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_6449">The Medical Cannabis Access Programme aims to facilitate access to certain cannabis products which have not been authorised as medicines by a statutory Medicines Competent Authority. As such, they are not subject to the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that are in place for medicines, nor are the producers subject to the same responsibilities as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. Whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important to be assured, as far as possible, of the quality of these products, as advised by the HPRA. However, the barrier to full operation is the availability of suitable product.</p>
            <p eId="para_6450"> Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is clearly critical in establishing the access programme. Department of Health officials are working intensively on this issue to ensure a supply of appropriate medical cannabis products to meet the needs of Irish patients. However, the Department of Health has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel such companies to supply their products to Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_6451"> An Expert Group has drawn up clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme. These guidelines are available on the Department’s website. The guidelines contain detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and guidance on which cannabis products are appropriate for medical use.</p>
            <p eId="para_6452"> Three Statutory Instruments (S.I.) made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts are required to underpin the establishment of the Access Programme. Department officials are working on this legislation, which will be finalised when medical cannabis products become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_6453"> Pending full operation of the Access Programme, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients.  Licences have now been granted in respect of thirteen individual patients. Until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed product from a pharmacy in The Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription.</p>

            <p eId="para_6488">I am informed by my colleague with responsibility for Older People, Minister Jim Daly, that the changing demographics and the implications for future health care costs underpin the importance of developing a wider choice of appropriate housing options for older people suited to their needs.  </p>
            <p eId="para_6489"> The aim is to encourage and facilitate timely planning by older people and to rebalance the care model away from residential care to supporting older people to remain living independently at home for longer.  As the research shows, this reflects the preferences of older people themselves. </p>
            <p eId="para_6490"> The aim is to ensure that older people will have more choice by developing a range of housing options that are suited to their needs, so they can plan ahead and, insofar as possible, choose the right option for them. These options may include retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives. </p>
            <p eId="para_6491"> However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that Minister Daly wishes to address. Ultimately the model of care with regard to older people must evolve and reform, including in relation to nursing homes. This is the vision set out in Sláintecare. </p>
            <p eId="para_6492"> In terms of my own responsibilities as Minister for Disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the Report “Time to Move on from Congregated Settings – A Strategy for Community Inclusion” proposes a new model of support in the community, moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. </p>
            <p eId="para_6493"> The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6494"> By the end of this year, it is expected that under 2,200 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual’s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>
            <p eId="para_6495"> In the context of residents in St Mary of the Angels, any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p>

            <p eId="para_6535">Reducing waiting time for patients for hospital operations and procedures is a key priority for the Government. This year has seen ongoing improvements with the number of patients waiting for inpatient and daycase procedures (IPDC), now at 72,000 from the peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6536"> In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF to increase from €55m in 2018 to €75m in 2019. </p>
            <p eId="para_6537"> My Department is working closely with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the HSE to finalise a coherent Waiting List Action Plan for 2019. </p>
            <p eId="para_6538"> In 2019, the NTPF will continue to work closely with Hospital Groups, inviting proposals to improve access for patients waiting for either Inpatient/Daycase or Outpatient procedures. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p>

            <p eId="para_6669"> - Establishment of a patient advocacy service.</p>
            <p eId="para_6670"> Public Consultation for the Patient Safety Complaints and Advocacy Policy took place between June and November of 2017 and a report of its findings was published in July 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_6671"> The consultation findings were analysed and key issues emerged from the consultation, grouped under four key themes to consider in the development of effective policy.  </p>

            <p eId="para_6678"> The Patient Safety Advocacy Service will provide free and independent advocacy in support of anyone wishing to make a formal complaint about the care or treatment they received in the health service and for anyone who has been involved in a patient safety incident.  The service will initially be focused on the public acute hospital sector.  </p>
            <p eId="para_6679"> Work has also been undertaken to develop a competency framework, and a recognised training programme, that will be undertaken in 2019 by the advocates engaged by the new service. </p>

            <p eId="para_6681"> In addition, my Department is continuing to review Statutory Instrument No. 652/2006 - Health Act 2004 (Complaints) Regulations 2006 with a view to enhancement of the statutory provisions for management of complaints within the health services and to consider the inclusion of clinical judgment in healthcare complaints. This review process will also encompass inputs from the Health Service Executive, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is expected that this process will conclude in 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_6709">Under the current Rural Development Regulation (and subsequent amendments under the Omnibus Regulation) Member States  are required to change the approach to the designation of land under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  To date my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density.</p>
            <p eId="para_6710"> From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p>

            <p eId="para_6720"> The outcome of the review project can be summarised as follows.  The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme will remain eligible under the new approach.  Some  700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible  under the new designation.  Farmers impacted financially by this  change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and  2020.  Over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_6721"> An independent appeals process is now being put in place for any farmers who wish to appeal the status of a particular townland following this process.  Farmers who hold land in townlands that are no longer eligible in 2019 are being written to, and included in this letter is an application form to begin the process of an appeal should they wish to take up this option.  This form is also available on the Department's website.  The appeals committee will be chaired independently, and will also have an independent technical expert on it.  The details in this regard are currently being finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_6728">As the Deputy is aware, 2018 presented the agriculture community with some very challenging conditions in terms of a prolonged wet Spring period followed almost immediately by a period of exceptionally dry, hot weather.  Notwithstanding these events there was a return in the third quarter of the year to more normal climatic conditions which benefitted the agriculture sector in terms of a late season grass growth. </p>
            <p eId="para_6729"> My priority throughout the year has been to support measures to assist in the conservation of as much fodder for this Winter as possible from within our own resources and to supplement this with necessary imports as required. To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures including:</p>
            <p eId="para_6730"> - a €2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure</p>
            <p eId="para_6731"> - a €4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st December 2018. </p>
            <p eId="para_6732"> In July I secured agreement from EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments, increased to 70% and 85% respectively. In excess of €1.5 billion has been paid to farmers to date under Pillar 1 and 2 since mid September. </p>
            <p eId="para_6733"> Following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year which have the potential to add to the quantities of winter fodder available by bringing over 260,000 additional hectares into production. In addition, in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. </p>
            <p eId="para_6734"> The most recent national fodder survey conducted on my behalf by Teagasc last October indicated that the national fodder shortfall has been reduced to 1% nationally.  It is clear that the various support interventions I have introduced have worked and continue to help alleviate what was a very serious fodder conservation issue on many farms during the dry summer period</p>
            <p eId="para_6735"> It is important to stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. </p>
            <p eId="para_6736"> I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation during the coming period.</p>

            <p eId="para_6740"> Our position has been reiterated many times, for example by myself and by my colleague, Minister Andrew Doyle, at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings, and by other Ministers in the relevant EU Trade policy fora. It has also been done through direct contacts with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstroem, and by the Taoiseach at European Council and through his own direct contacts, including with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron. I have also been working closely with Member State colleagues in this regard, and have remained in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_6742"> In an overall sense there is undoubtedly a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. I also continue to stress that full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission’s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.</p>

            <p eId="para_6757">Under the current Rural Development Regulation (and subsequent amendments under the Omnibus Regulation) Member States  are required to change the approach to the designation of land under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme.  To date my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density.</p>
            <p eId="para_6758"> From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p>
            <p eId="para_6759"> - Low  temperature      </p>
            <p eId="para_6760"> - Dryness</p>
            <p eId="para_6761"> - Excess soil moisture</p>
            <p eId="para_6762"> - Limited soil drainage</p>
            <p eId="para_6763"> - Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p>
            <p eId="para_6764"> - Shallow rooting depth</p>
            <p eId="para_6765"> - Poor chemical properties</p>
            <p eId="para_6766"> - Steep slope</p>
            <p eId="para_6767"> This process has now been completed and in recent weeks I have published details in relation to the outcome and have completed a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_6768"> The outcome of the review project can be summarised as follows.  The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme will remain eligible under the new approach.  Some  700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible  under the new designation.  Farmers impacted financially by this  change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and  2020.  Over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_6769"> An independent appeals process is now being put in place for any farmers who wish to appeal the status of a particular townland following this process.  Farmers who hold land in townlands that are no longer eligible in 2019 are being written to, and included in this letter is an application form to begin the process of an appeal should they wish to take up this option.  This form is also available on the Department's website.  The appeals committee will be chaired independently, and will also have an independent technical expert on it.  The details in this regard are currently being finalised. </p>

            <p eId="para_7360">The National Mitigation Plan, published in July 2017, restates the Government’s commitment to move from a fossil fuel-based electricity system to a low-carbon power system. Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised. The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, approved by government in July 2018, will provide for a renewable electricity ambition of 55% by 2030, subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan. Currently, 30% of our electricity is generated from renewable. </p>
            <p eId="para_7361"> I have secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken  to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will include the steps which we must take in order to reach this target. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_7362"> In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more Co2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. </p>
            <p eId="para_7363"> So while gas usage will reduce significantly in the years ahead, Ireland will still need secure sources of gas. At present this is provided by both gas piped on shore from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. </p>
            <p eId="para_7364"> The development of an LNG facility could further enhance Ireland’s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State’s commitments to tackle climate change.  </p>
            <p eId="para_7365"> Ireland’s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU’s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p>

            <p eId="para_7687">Addressing climate change and our targets to 2030 and beyond is one of the key policy priorities for this Government. Since my appointment as Minister I have secured Government approval to prepare an All of Government Plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_7688"> This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by Government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan, and is to be completed by early new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_7689">Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government’s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost €22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that well over €1 in €5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.  </p>
            <p eId="para_7690">The Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which I chair and which includes representation from all relevant Government Departments and Agencies, meets at least quarterly to drive progress by sectors and agencies on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan as well as the National Adaptation Framework. This group, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, chaired by An Taoiseach.  </p>
            <p eId="para_7691"> In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, along with other relevant Ministers, provided oral reports to both Houses last week. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. </p>

            <p eId="para_7694">The National Development Plan (NDP), published in February 2018, commits to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost €22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. A further €8.6bn will be made available for investments in sustainable transport measures. This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. Initial estimates of the potential emissions reduction contribution from full delivery of the relevant commitments in the NDP are set out in the 2018 Annual Transition Statement, published by my Department and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 3 December last. These estimates suggest a cumulative total savings in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 22 million tonnes of CO2 over the period 2021 to 2030, when compared to the most recent emissions projections published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018. Work to further refine this initial estimate is continuing in the context of the draft National Energy and Climate Plan and the EPA's 2019 emissions projections.</p>
            <p eId="para_7695"> Where the proposed commitment in the NDP is directly relevant to the achievement of Ireland’s climate targets and specific policy assumptions can be made about the delivery of a given commitment, the cumulative effect of such commitments will be incorporated into projections included the draft National Energy and Climate Plan and in the annual emissions projections report prepared by the EPA.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanCanney" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment" eId="spk_787">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment<recordedTime time="2018-12-11T00:27:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7697">There are no plans to change Government policy in respect of offshore oil and gas exploration. In the context of Ireland's transition to a low carbon energy future, it is accepted that Ireland will continue to need oil and particularly gas for quite some time, though their use must significantly reduce. Ending all future oil and gas exploration in Irish waters and placing a full moratorium on exploration activity would not impact the amount of emissions Ireland creates by burning fossil fuels; rather it will commit Ireland to source all of its oil and gas from abroad. </p>
            <p eId="para_7698"> The Government's approach to tackle emissions from fossil fuels is to focus efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy which make essential contributions to all of the major objectives of climate and energy policies, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability, and the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_7699"> Minister Bruton has secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.   </p>
            <p eId="para_7700"> Notwithstanding occasional speculative comment as to the potential of the Irish offshore in terms of oil and gas, it is only through active exploration that such potential will be proven. Ireland’s offshore remains underexplored with only a fraction of the exploration experience of Norway and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_7701"> Early exploration efforts viewed the petroleum geology of the Irish offshore as being comparable to that of the North Sea. However, lack of success from drilling efforts in the 1970s and 1980s led to a decline in interest. However, industry perspectives have been transformed in recent years. While the North Sea comparison retains potential, two new possibilities have also emerged. Successful exploration off the Atlantic coasts of Africa and South America has stimulated new interest in the prospectivity of the Atlantic margins, with new data, analysis and targets. Research on the Newfoundland-Ireland conjugate margins has demonstrated the potential for Ireland to replicate the oil and gas success of Newfoundland-Labrador exploration.</p>
            <p eId="para_7702"> Marine industrial activities, such as oil and gas exploration and production, require careful assessment, management and regulation in order to protect the marine environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7703"> In advance of the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licencing Round, my Department undertook the Irish Offshore Strategic Environmental Assessment (IOSEA) 5 Environmental Report in respect of oil and gas exploration activities in the Irish offshore. Policy in respect of exploration activities carried out under a petroleum authorisation is informed by IOSEA5.</p>
            <p eId="para_7704"> Proposals to carry out exploration or production activities on a petroleum authorisation in the Irish offshore, for example the acquisition of seismic or the drilling of a well, are subject to assessment of compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. In addition, the observations of the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding potential impacts on Annex IV Protected Species and sites protected under the Birds and Habitats legislation are sought. </p>
            <p eId="para_7705"> The recent completion of the ObSERVE Programme led by my Department has highlighted the rich diversity of cetaceans and seabirds in the Irish offshore. The findings of the Programme are already informing the environmental aspects of decision making in respect of applications for exploration activities. </p>
            <p eId="para_7706"> Scientific research regarding the potential for exploration activities to have an adverse impact on plankton and fish with trophic links to cetaceans is limited and not settled. My Department is mindful of the need to keep abreast of current international research projects in this regard. </p>

            <p eId="para_7708">The first recommendation of the Citizens’ Assembly report on the topic of “How the State can make Ireland a Leader in Tackling Climate Change” included a proposal that a new or existing independent body, resourced appropriately and given a broad range of new functions and powers, be mandated to propose five year national and sectorial targets for emissions reductions. The regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland is currently determined through two different mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_7709"> Emissions from power generation and large industrial installations are regulated by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which imposes an overall emissions target at EU level rather than Member State level. </p>
            <p eId="para_7710"> Emissions from other sectors of the economy, including agriculture, transport, buildings, waste, and other industrial sectors are subject to targets at Member State level. The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020 for these non-ETS sectors. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their levels in 2005. </p>
            <p eId="para_7711"> For the period to 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets out binding annual emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland’s target under this Regulation will require a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. In addition to the specific target for 2030, the ESR also imposes annual emissions ceilings for each Member State over the period 2021-2030. These annual ceilings therefore determine the Member State's carbon budget for the period. </p>
            <p eId="para_7712"> I have recently received a mandate from Government to begin the preparation of a new All of Government Plan to bring about a step change in our climate ambition over the next decade, and beyond. My vision is that this new Plan will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. </p>
            <p eId="para_7713"> I am currently working with my officials to develop proposals for the new plan, and I will shortly be engaging with my colleagues across Government in this regard. These actions will cover: </p>

            <p eId="para_7724"> Addressing climate change, whether through decarbonisation of our economy, or preparing to adapt to the impacts of climate change, is one of the most significant challenges of this century. The publication on 8 October of the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 C confirms the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. </p>
            <p eId="para_7725"> Ireland has fully supported the level of ambition in recent negotiations to reform the EU ETS and to put in place Member State targets for non-ETS sectors under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Ireland also continues to support high ambition in on-going negotiations at EU level in relation to emissions standards for both Light- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. I consider it essential that the EU seeks high ambition in all of its sectorial policies and targets for 2030, which will be essential in supporting individual Member States to achieve their respective targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation and may enable the EU as a whole to achieve emissions reductions by 2030 in excess of the 40% reduction on 1990 levels already committed to by the European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_7726"> Ireland supports strong EU ambition in order to contribute to the Paris Agreement objectives. It is vital that the EU long-term strategy to be adopted on foot of the European Commission’s recent proposals can be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with all Member States participating in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness, cost-effectiveness and solidarity. In Ireland’s case, any revision to interim targets for 2030 would also need to take into account our specific socio-economic circumstances, including our large agriculture sector, light industrial base, small ETS sector, and dispersed settlement patterns.  </p>
            <p eId="para_7727"> I have recently secured Government approval to prepare an All of Government Plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland. This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by Government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan, and is to be completed by the end of February 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_7736"> The Marine Survey Office (MSO) in my Department acts in the capacity of Safety Regulator for the maritime industry. </p>
            <p eId="para_7737"> When the owner of the vessel in question sought to operate under the Irish Flag, the MSO became aware of serious safety issues relating to the stability of the vessel. Ireland has a national safety regime for such fishing vessels which is based on the Torremolinos Convention and EU Directive 97/70, as amended. </p>
            <p eId="para_7738"> The registration process of another State does not come under the remit of this Department. However to ensure compliance with the relevant maritime safety regime, Ireland raised a safety alert in 2013 with the Committee on Safe Seas (COSS) which  deals with EU maritime matters  and also brought it to the attention of the European Commission. The net point of that alert was that there was likely a number of other similar sister vessels across the EU which would pose similar safety based risks.  I am aware that the European Commission communicated this risk to other relevant Member States and also attempted to secure some clarification with parties involved with the initial testing of the vessel.</p>

            <p eId="para_7774">While all new trains and new train stations are accessible from the design stage, many of the older stations on the rail network date from the 19th century and were not accessible for people with disabilities. Under the Accessibility Retro-fit programme, these stations are progressively being made accessible. </p>
            <p eId="para_7775"> As part of this work, I provided additional funding in September of this year for the development a new accessibility app to address some of the key communication breakdowns that occur when providing assistance to persons with disabilities travelling on the Irish Rail network. The technology will allow people to pre-book a journey that confirms they will have Operative assistance at their departure and arrival stations, and provide them with support in an emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_7776"> Earlier this month I announced that further funding is being provided for the second phase of this project. Irish Rail intends to roll out the Accessibility App initially on DART services and then onto commuter services. </p>
            <p eId="para_7777">Irish Rail are currently looking for volunteers who have mobility and vision impairments and who are regular DART users, to become part of a research panel which will include live testing of a prototype of the app. Details can be found at http://www.irishrail.ie/access-dart-app or by contacting by calling (01) 703 4837 or by emailing accesspilot@irishrail.ie </p>
            <p eId="para_7778"> I would encourage those who would benefit from this technology to volunteer for the research panel so that they can provide the necessary feedback and input to ensure the app meets their needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_7787"> I met the Secretary of State at my request in London on 26 May 2017 to discuss the transport implications of Brexit.

            <p eId="para_7788"> In relation to the most recent meeting, the parameters of the discussion were clearly communicated to the Secretary of State in advance, in particular the need to  fully respect the mandate of the EU’s Chief Negotiator in negotiating for the MS27 and that the discussion could not stray into the area of negotiations. </p>
            <p eId="para_7789"> At that meeting of 8 November, the Secretary of State Grayling outlined the key areas of concern for the UK in relation to transport.  For my part, I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including in relation to ports, aviation, road transport, and cross-border rail.  I stressed the importance of finalising the Withdrawal Agreement, highlighted the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports.    </p>
            <p eId="para_7790"> I stressed that as regards the future EU-UK relationship, Ireland wants to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, across a range of areas including transport. At the same time, I re-iterated the importance of preserving the integrity of the EU’s Single Market and that the EU’s regulatory autonomy is respected.</p>

            <p eId="para_7846">At the recent launch of its 2019 marketing strategy and plans, Tourism Ireland set out its targets for 2019. Next year, it aims to grow overseas tourism revenue by +6% to €6.5 billion for the island of Ireland and to grow visitor numbers to 11.67 million (+4%). 2019 will undoubtedly present some challenges – not least the continued uncertainty around Brexit, which may impact on consumer confidence and, in turn, on outbound travel from Britain. Competitiveness and value for money will continue to be a key message  in Britain and elsewhere next year. Other challenges include economic and geo-political uncertainty, as well as the potential for oil price inflation. </p>
            <p eId="para_7847"> Budget 2019 provided for the largest increase in the tourism budget in 15 years. Additional funding has been allocated to both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland to respond to the impact of Brexit and to spread the economic benefits of tourism  across the year and around the country. The detailed plans of the agencies are an operational matter for the boards and management of Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland. I have referred this part of the Deputy's question to the tourism agencies for direct reply. Please contact my private office if you have not received a reply within ten working days.</p>

            <p eId="para_7877"> The cost of childcare in Ireland is a major challenge for families in Ireland. In particular it is a challenge to mothers returning to work and single parent families. Due to decades of underinvestment, we have inherited one of the most expensive models of early learning and care in Europe. But this is changing. </p>
            <p eId="para_7878"> Record numbers of families availed of Government subsidies to reduce this cost for families; including more than 40,000 children registered for the universal, non means tested subsidy of up to €1,040 per year whilst tens of thousands of families that needed it most received subsidies of up to €145 per week deducted from their childcare fees. This year the rise in cost charged for childcare was 2%, half of what was experienced the previous year. </p>
            <p eId="para_7879"> In addition the number of children participating in the ECCE (free pre-school) scheme has doubled; whilst the scheme itself has lengthened to 76 weeks per child. </p>
            <p eId="para_7880">  Earlier this year the Oireachtas signed the Childcare Support Act; putting the entitlement to financial support for childcare on a legislative footing for the first time. </p>
            <p eId="para_7881"> In 2019, we will launch the Affordable Childcare Scheme, a radical new approach to how families access financial support towards quality early learning and care. </p>
            <p eId="para_7882"> It will take time to deliver the world class system of early learning and care that families deserve but I am confident that we are moving swiftly in the right direction to achieve this goal. </p>

            <p eId="para_8016">The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting the child is attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p>
            <p eId="para_8017"> AIM Level 4 support is a targeted support that provides expert advice and mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. These staff are based in Better Start, the National Early Years Quality Development Service. </p>
            <p eId="para_8018"> AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child’s participation in the ECCE Programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p>
            <p eId="para_8019"> The pre-school service referred to in the question has been granted AIM Level 4 and AIM Level 7 support in respect of children attending the service in the 2018/2019 ECCE year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8020"> The pre-school service submitted a review request to Pobal in relation to the level of AIM support granted to a number of children attending the service on 29th November 2018. This review request was acknowledged on 3rd December 2018. Pobal has advised the applicant that a decision will be made within 25 working days of receipt of the review request.</p>

Brexit has been discussed at meetings of the BIC Early Years Working Group in the context of our ongoing discussions about the Early Years sectors of each represented jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_8025"> The Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to support East–West Trade. These include staffing, ICT and infrastructure measures to implement necessary checks and controls at our ports and airports.  To support businesses, the Government provided dedicated Brexit support measures in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. Ireland is working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and to facilitate the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.  </p>

Going missing from care can include missing a curfew, or an unscheduled absence from a care placement, and does not always mean that a child has disappeared or run away. It is important to note that one child could be reported missing more than once. There should be no inference made about whether these children made applications for international protection or not.

            <p eId="para_8428">I propose to take Questions Nos. 485 to 488, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8429"> Aftercare services build on and support the work that has already been undertaken by many, including foster carers, social workers and residential workers, in preparing young people for adulthood. Therefore the provision of aftercare services should not be seen as an event, but something that builds on the skills and capacity that young people have learned and developed during their time in care.</p>
            <p eId="para_8430"> Tusla has undertaken an extensive review of policy as it relates to Aftercare Service Provision and developed a suite of policies and guidance documents to support the delivery of aftercare services.</p>
            <p eId="para_8431"> Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. The Act created an explicit statement of Tusla’s duty to satisfy itself as to the child’s or young person’s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. An eligible child for the purpose of this statutory entitlement is any child who has spent 12 months in the care of the State in the 5 years between the ages of 13 and 18 years old, while an eligible adult is any young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. </p>
            <p eId="para_8432"> Aftercare encompasses a range of services, which can include direct financial support in the form of the aftercare allowance. The purpose of the allowance is to cover the day to day costs associated in supporting a young person as they progress in education or accredited training.</p>
            <p eId="para_8433"> To qualify for an aftercare allowance at 18 years of age an eligible adult must be attending an accredited education course or training programme as outlined in their aftercare plan, and agree to engage with aftercare service requirements and provide updates on their progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_8434"> Tusla does not collect the number of young people who seek or receive an aftercare allowance for the purpose of supporting them in education/accredited training. Tusla does however maintain records of those who are in education/accredited training. All young adults who are in accredited training/education are entitled to financial support for this purpose <b>.</b></p>
            <p eId="para_8435"> At the end of September 2018, there were 1,257 young persons in aftercare in education/accredited training.</p>
            <p eId="para_8436"> It should be noted that aftercare is a service for adults, and their engagement with Tusla in relation to aftercare is purely on a voluntary basis. Tusla has no power to oblige a young person to avail of the support offered.</p>
            <p eId="para_8437"> The number of young people who have left the care of Tusla upon reaching 18 years of age in each of the years 2015 to 2017 is set out in tabular form.</p>

            <p eId="para_8447">My Department has commenced a process to identify service development needs for 2019 and to finalise the 2019 youth funding allocations. The primary purpose of this process is to ensure that youth services are sufficiently resourced to meet the needs of young people and particularly those who are at risk of drugs or alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8448"> In this regard, officials within my Department are currently awaiting the return of completed funding renewal applications on behalf of youth projects throughout the country which are due to be submitted by 21 December 2018.  On receipt of these completed renewal applications, my Department will be in a position to finalise the funding allocation which will be provided for each youth project in 2019, having regard to the overall budgetary position.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible and notify all youth services of their allocation at the earliest possible date.</p>

            <p eId="para_8450">The pilot scheme to encourage people to return to living in town centres was launched on 11th October 2018.  </p>
            <p eId="para_8451"> A Steering Group, chaired by my Department, was established earlier this year to examine the issue, and a lot of consideration was given by the Group to the best approach to developing a model which would deliver on the objective of increasing town centre living. </p>
            <p eId="para_8452"> The Steering Group noted that some schemes which have specifically attempted to focus on the renovation of vacant properties have had a disappointing take-up. It is clear that if we are to successfully encourage people to return to living in town centres, an integrated solution involving all aspects of town living and supporting infrastructure, needs to be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_8453"> The Steering Group therefore agreed that a pilot scheme, which takes a holistic approach to town centre living, should be developed in a small number of towns initially, with a view to a wider roll-out over time. This approach, which I approved, will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a small number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations. The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_8454"> Six rural towns were invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme.  They are: </p>
            <p eId="para_8455"> 1. Boyle, Co Roscommon</p>
            <p eId="para_8456"> 2. Callan, Co Kilkenny</p>
            <p eId="para_8457"> 3. Ballinrobe, Co Mayo</p>
            <p eId="para_8458"> 4. Banagher, Co Offaly</p>
            <p eId="para_8459"> 5. Castleblayney, Co Monaghan</p>
            <p eId="para_8460"> 6. Cappoquin, Co Waterford.</p>
            <p eId="para_8461"> Each of these towns will receive funding of up to €100,000 to engage with their communities and local businesses, and arrive at practical solutions that can be delivered to achieve the objective of increasing the number of people living in our rural towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_8462"> Representatives from each of the six Local Authorities involved in the pilot recently met with my Department to begin the process of developing the detailed schemes.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns will lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_8471">The first call for applications for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed at the end of September.  €1 billion is committed to the Fund over a 10 year period to support rural economic development and help build strong communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8472"> There was an excellent response to the first call, with nearly 300 applications received.  Applications for the Fund are currently being examined by the Project Advisory Board, made up of representatives from key Government Departments and external experts, which was established to oversee the assessment process.  Category 1 "shovel ready" projects were prioritised in the assessment process and Category 2 projects - those which need development funding to become potential Category 1 applications in future calls for applications - are now being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_8480"> The objective of the AEC project is to maximise the assets along the western seaboard and connect the economic hubs, clusters and catchments of the region to attract investment, support job creation and contribute to an improved quality of life for people in the region.  The National Planning Framework recognises the contribution which the AEC initiative can make to supporting the regional growth objectives of the NPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_8481"> Minister Ring established the Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in March 2017 to oversee and progress the initiative.  I now chair the Taskforce which meets every quarter, with the most recent meeting taking place yesterday, 10th December. </p>
            <p eId="para_8482"> Three subgroups have been established to support the work of the Taskforce, focusing on the issues of infrastructure, enterprise space and communications and marketing.  Work programmes have been developed for each of these subgroups. </p>
            <p eId="para_8483"> My Department also provides co-funding for a dedicated AEC Officer in each of the Local Authorities along the Corridor.  This AEC Officer network provides a resource to support the work of the AEC Taskforce, and to promote the AEC concept across the region as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_8484"> Over the last few weeks, projects based in the AEC area were approved for funding of €50 million from three Government funds - the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, and the Regional Enterprise Development Fund.  This investment, along with other infrastructural investments under the National Development Plan, will support the objectives of the AEC initiative to attract jobs and investment to the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_8486">The recent review of the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Scheme 2014-16 and 2017-2019 identifies the need for better communication and awareness building with regard to the fund, including across Government Departments, potential beneficiaries and the public. </p>
            <p eId="para_8487"> Specific actions taken in this regard include writing to Government Ministers at the start of the Dormant Accounts Action Plan process to raise awareness of the possibility of Dormant Accounts Funding for measures in their policy areas that address economic, social or educational disadvantage, or support persons with a disability. Furthermore, in July 2018 there was a formal launch of the Action Plan for the first time, which showcased funded measures and projects and generated significant media attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_8488"> The issue of further increasing awareness of the fund will also be considered by the recently established interdepartmental group, and as part of that work guidance will be developed to ensure that funding recipients across all policy areas acknowledge and promote the fact that they are being funded from Dormant Account moneys, with the aim of raising wider public awareness of fund benefits and potential. </p>
            <p eId="para_8489"> Finally, with regard to the social enterprise measure administered by Pobal on behalf of this Department, pre-application support was provided to potential applicants, including an information day in Tullamore. This helped to ensure that potential applicants for that specific measure were fully informed on the funding call. </p>
            <p eId="para_8490"> Benefits of further information days and other awareness arising initiatives will continue to be explored and advanced to ensure maximum use is made of the fund to benefit citizens. </p>

            <p eId="para_8687">I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 and 502 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8688">As Minister with responsibility for Rural and Community Development, I am leading a Department whose mission it is to help build vibrant, sustainable communities across the country, both in rural and urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8689"> To do this requires a mix of policy initiatives and actions focused on enabling economic growth and development and to address gaps in meeting the social needs in these areas, thus supporting our communities to become and remain desirable places to live, work and raise families. </p>
            <p eId="para_8690"> Many of these initiatives form part of the Government's published Action Plan for Rural Development and Framework Policy for Local and Community Development which include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing issues in local communities, including financial assistance and other direct and indirect supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_8691"> My Department is currently finalising an implementation plan for the Framework Policy for Local and Community Development and I am confident that the implementation plan will propose actions that will support the local and community development sectors to continue providing valuable services to both urban and rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8692"> In addition, Project Ireland 2040 will help breathe new life into communities across the country, providing access to recreational and leisure facilities, by increasing the attractiveness of communities to visitors and, most importantly, by supporting job creation and employment for people in both urban and rural areas. This includes the €1 billion being invested through my Department in towns and villages across Ireland through the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_8693"> My Department is also committed to the successful delivery of a range of other schemes and programmes which are greatly benefitting rural and urban communities. Programmes such as LEADER, CLÁR, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Local Improvement Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Scheme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme and the Community Enhancement Programme have delivered funding and supports to numerous small and large-scale projects, many of which are identified and driven by local community organisations. </p>
            <p eId="para_8694"> Full details of these and other programmes are available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_8697">I propose to take Questions Nos. 503 and 510 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8698"> My Department operates a number of funding programmes and schemes that are open to applications from relevant parties, including groups in the voluntary sector, who satisfy the relevant criteria during the application timeframes set for each scheme/programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8699"> This includes a range of direct supports to projects in Co Kildare and across the country that are developed or administered by community groups and my Department will continue this investment into 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_8700"> The Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national organisations in the voluntary sector, with a focus on organisations that provide supports to those who are disadvantaged. The current three-year scheme runs to 30 June 2019, and all funding has been fully allocated for 2018. </p>
            <p eId="para_8701"> Additionally, €3.5 million was allocated by my Department in 2018 to support the work of volunteering organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_8702"> The Community Services Programme (CSP), which has an allocation for 2018 of €44 million, supports community-based organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model for services which are not being met through public or private funding. €429,078 was allocated to Kildare in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_8703"> The Community Enhancement Programme provides small capital grants to community groups across the country, including Men's Sheds, and has been allocated a total of €13million in 2018, of which €468,671 has been allocated to groups in Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_8704"> The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is a key intervention for disadvantaged communities, offering supports to both individuals and local community groups. The current programme commenced at the start of 2018 and runs until 2022 and is delivered locally by Local Development Companies in 51 Lot Areas. The funding allocation to County Kildare for 2018 was €1,061,036. </p>
            <p eId="para_8705"> I also approved funding of €73,000 to Tidy Towns committees in Kildare in 2018. The work done by these committees is of great value to local communities and we should all be grateful for the effort they make in our towns and villages.</p>
            <p eId="para_8706"> Voluntary and community groups may also be able to access funding under the CLÁR Programme and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8707"> Funding may also be available under the LEADER Programme to support community and voluntary groups in rural Ireland. The Kildare Local Action Group (LAG) have been allocated €5,261,600 over the 2014-2020 programming period and applications for funding can be made to the LAG.</p>

            <p eId="para_8711">The issue of isolation, whether in urban or rural areas, is one which requires a response containing a combination of policy initiatives and actions delivered across a number of Government Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_8712"> For my part, I am committed to continuing my Department's response to the issue, which includes ongoing contact with local and community groups and other stakeholders where appropriate to identify potential measures to assist communities affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_8713"> Groups can also input into the policy-making process through the local structures established by my Department such as Public Participation Networks and Local Community Development Committees. </p>
            <p eId="para_8714"> The publication on 7 December 2018 of the Call for Input Paper on Volunteering is the first step in developing a national volunteering policy. Volunteering plays a critical in empowering individuals to become more involved in their communities and is proven to assist with the development of mental health well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_8715"> The Government’s Action Plan for Rural Development and Framework Policy for Local and Community Development include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in both rural and urban areas and as Minister for Rural and Community Development I will continue to advocate for a cross government approach to ensuring the rural and community voice is heard in relation to matters of policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_8716"> Specific examples of actions being delivered by my Department which are helping those who feel isolated or vulnerable in communities include:</p>
            <p eId="para_8717"> - Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-based     support for vulnerable older people living alone. To the end of October, spend on the Scheme amounted to €5.5 million, with over 16,000 applications for personal alarms approved so far this year. This is an important programme which enables older persons of limited means to continue to live in their own homes at the heart of their communities with confidence, independence and peace of mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_8718"> - The new five-year Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, which commenced at the start of 2018, is our country’s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a national programme that will be delivered locally with funding of €190 million over a five-year period to help those in the greatest need.</p>
            <p eId="para_8719"> - Support for approximately 350 Men’s Sheds across Ireland which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. In July I provided funding of €500,000 to support the work of Men’s Sheds throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8720"> In addition, other actions in the Action Plan for Rural Development being delivered by Departments across government that will help those who feel isolated or vulnerable include:</p>
            <p eId="para_8721"> - Investment of €46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Gardaí are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_8722"> - Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8723"> - Continued support and prioritisation of community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert.</p>
            <p eId="para_8724"> - Continued improvements in the Rural Transport Programme, including the provision of new routes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8726">The remit of my Department is to help build vibrant, sustainable communities across the country. Achieving this goal requires a mix of policy initiatives and funding schemes to improve both economic development and to address gaps in meeting the social needs in rural areas, including isolated rural areas. </p>
            <p eId="para_8727"> The Action Plan for Rural Development, published in January 2017, represents a significant whole-of-Government approach to addressing identified challenges facing rural Ireland. The Action Plan is fully aligned with the strategic objective set out in the National Planning Framework focused on strengthening our rural economies and communities, and enabling all areas of the country to reach their full potential. </p>
            <p eId="para_8728"> My own Department delivers a range of programmes which promote and support sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  For example:</p>
            <p eId="para_8729"> - The Town and Village Renewal Scheme supports the revitalisation of rural towns and villages, with particular focus on projects which have a clear positive economic impact on local communities. In total, almost €53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme since it was introduced in the second half of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_8730"> - The CLÁR programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas which provides funding for small infrastructural projects and other initiatives in areas that have experienced significant levels of population decline. More than 1,250 projects have been approved for total funding of €26.9 million since I relaunched the programme in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_8731"> - The €250 million LEADER rural development programme includes a specific pillar focused on social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_8732"> - The Seniors Alert Scheme provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms for older people to enable them to live securely in their own homes. This is particularly valuable for older people living alone in isolated rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8733"> My Department maintains ongoing contact with stakeholders to identify issues that affect both urban and rural communities.  </p>
            <p eId="para_8734"> My Department is also co-hosting a series of seminars on rural issues with the Royal Irish Academy, focusing on the themes of economic development, social inclusion and sustainable rural communities.  These seminars will culminate in the publication of a research report on issues impacting rural communities.  The first of these seminars took place in Galway in November and will be followed by two further events early in 2019.</p>

            <p eId="para_8741"> Under the current 2014-2020 programme, 25 of the LAGs are Local Community Development Committees.  The community-based Local Development Companies interface with local communities as the Implementing Partners for the LAGs.  The Local Authorities provide financial oversight as the Lead Financial Partners.  </p>

            <p eId="para_8746">The availability of a high quality, high speed broadband network and of reliable mobile phone coverage are essential components underpinning the connectivity and development of rural communities in Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_8747"> In this context, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce was established in July 2016 to identify solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and to investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to full rollout of the National Broadband Plan. The Taskforce published its final report in December 2016, which set out 40 actions aimed at addressing the issues associated with mobile phone and broadband connectivity, particularly in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8748"> An Implementation Group, co-ordinated by my Department was established in early 2017 to ensure that the actions identified by the Taskforce are implemented in a timely manner. That Group published its first progress review in February of this year, highlighting a number of significant achievements which have been made. The review can be found on my Department’s website, www.drcd.gov.ie.  </p>
            <p eId="para_8749"> In terms of the actions directly under my Department's remit, the appointment of Broadband Officers in each Local Authority, which my Department co-finances, is impacting positively on increased levels of communications with the telecoms industry and in identifying and addressing barriers to the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure.  This has seen a tangible increase in broadband connections and the resolution of a number of mobile phone blackspots in rural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8750"> Regular meetings of the Regional Action Group are held across the country, bringing together Local Authority Broadband Officers and providing opportunities to share knowledge and experiences and to investigate issues that will impact on the provision of rural telecommunications services.  </p>
            <p eId="para_8751"> Furthermore, my Department, in cooperation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, are exploring the feasibility of developing a standardised policy for accessing and utilising State assets for the deployment of telecoms infrastructure. </p>
            <p eId="para_8752"> Outside of the work of the Implementation Group, my Department has provided funding to support the establishment of a mobile phone mast in Malin Beg, Co. Donegal. The residents of Malin Beg have never had a reliable mobile phone signal, leaving them at a distinct disadvantage. Thanks to the efforts of local community and the local authority, they will soon have coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_8753"> My Department also co-ordinated and supported Local Authority applications for the European Commission's WiFi4EU initiative. This programme will see EU funds made available for the provision of free, publically accessible WiFi.  In the inaugural round of funding announced last week, 21 Irish Local Authorities secured funding for 59 projects under the scheme, worth €885,000 in total.  My Department will make matching funds of up to €15,000 available for each of these projects, to support Local Authorities as they make free internet connectivity available to the public. </p>

            <p eId="para_8779">Certain sections in Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child. The current position is that these sections need to be amended, to correct technical errors, and have yet to be commenced. My intention is to correct these technical errors by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which I hope to see taken early in the new year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8780"> Commencement of these provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 &amp; 3 of the Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health. In this regard, the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018. It was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp; 3 of the Act. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act. I know that it is Minister for Health's intention that Parts 2 &amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.   </p>
            <p eId="para_8781"> In order to progress this, officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational, mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children.  </p>

            <p eId="para_8845">My Department regularly reviews the habitual residence guidelines to ensure they are fit for purpose. The guidelines, although drafted for Departmental decision-makers, are published online and offer detailed guidance on the most appropriate course of action when applying the criteria with respect to habitual residence. </p>
            <p eId="para_8846"> They include specific guidance relating to returning migrants or those resuming previous residence in the State. This includes the arrangements made by the Department with the registered charity Safe Home to assist with any difficulties Irish emigrants may have in satisfying the provisions with respect to habitual residence. </p>
            <p eId="para_8847"> In addition, training in the assessment of the provisions with respect of habitual residence is available to all decision-makers within my Department. The training places a strong emphasis on case studies and the previous experiences of the participants. </p>
            <p eId="para_8848"> The Department has an information leaflet (SW108), which outlines the key issues with respect to the habitual residence provisions and their application, as well as a Q&amp;A and further contact information. </p>
            <p eId="para_8849"> The Citizens Information Board, under the auspices of my Department, provides a comprehensive and readily accessible guide to the provisions with respect to habitual residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_8850"> Each assistance claim receives a determination in relation to the Habitual Residence Condition in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. The determination of a person’s habitual residence is made in accordance with five factors which are set out in legislation, as follows: </p>
            <p eId="para_8851"> (a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country; </p>
            <p eId="para_8852"> (b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State; </p>
            <p eId="para_8853"> (c) the nature and pattern of the person’s employment; </p>
            <p eId="para_8854"> (d) the person’s main centre of interest, and </p>
            <p eId="para_8855"> (e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances. </p>
            <p eId="para_8856"> These five factors have been derived from European Court of Justice case law, and are generally sufficient to enable the deciding officer to determine whether a person’s present circumstances in Ireland indicate a temporary visit or habitual residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_8857"> In addition to a review of any decision by my Department, claimants can also appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO). This Office functions independently of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_8865">I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 to 530, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8866">Overpayments of social welfare assistance and benefit payments arise as a consequence of decisions made under the relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended).  Where an overpayment is raised, my Department is obligated to make every effort to recover sums overpaid.</p>
            <p eId="para_8867"> The balance of any debts arising on any scheme outstanding at the time of death of a debtor can be recovered from the deceased debtor’s estate.  A debt may also arise during the settlement of a deceased customer’s estate where it is  determined that the customer had not adequately declared their means during the time they were receiving a means-tested payment during their lifetime. If, subsequent to the death of a customer, it comes to light that not all of the deceased’s means were properly disclosed, the Department will seek to recover any monies overpaid from the estate of the deceased.</p>
            <p eId="para_8868"> Under s.339 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, the personal representative of a deceased person who was at any time in receipt of a means-tested payment is obliged to give notice to the Department of their intention to distribute the assets of the estate and to provide a schedule of the assets of the  estate.</p>
            <p eId="para_8869"> The Department issues a notification to the deceased's personal representative advising them of their obligations under law.  If there is an estate to be distributed, a schedule of assets must be provided to the Department.  The personal representative is instructed not to distribute the estate without formal clearance from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8870"> The statement of assets is examined to see if there are assets which were previously not declared to the Department by the deceased.  In the event that there are none, the personal representative will be informed and can proceed to distribute the estate.  A social welfare inspector may be tasked with making enquiries and to provide a report to support the assessment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8871"> If assets were previously not declared, the Department will calculate the value of any monies paid in excess of entitlements and seek the recovery of same before the estate is distributed.  Any decisions made that the personal representative is dissatisfied with may be reviewed at their request.  The personal representative has a right to appeal any decision made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>
            <p eId="para_8872"> In seeking to recover an overpayment from the estate, the value of the estate is reduced by the (reasonable) funeral expenses for which the estate is liable and full recovery of the debt is sought from the remaining assets.  In cases of insolvent estates, full recovery may not be possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_8873"> When all monies have been recovered, a letter of clearance allowing the distribution of the estate will issue to the personal representative. In the event of failure to comply with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, or to make efforts to pay back the sums overpaid, the Department reserves a right to prosecute under the Act and/or to seek civil recovery through the Courts.  Given the costs and time involved, the parties generally agree a negotiated resolution. Where there are no remaining assets in an estate, the outstanding balance that cannot be recovered may be written-off.</p>
            <p eId="para_8874">I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_8884">The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market to secure and sustain full-time paid employment. These supports include the JobPath service.  </p>
            <p eId="para_8885"> JobPath is an employment service, which helps long-term unemployed people to secure and sustain paid employment. The service was launched in 2015 on a ‘rolling basis’ with referral numbers gradually increasing over time</p>
            <p eId="para_8886"> There are two phases to the service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the client for a further period of up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_8887"> To date, just over 195,000 clients have commenced their engagement period with the service as set out in the table below </p>
            <p eId="para_8888"> The department is undertaking an econometric review of this strand of its activation services.  Completion of the review is provisionally scheduled for the end of 2018, following which more detailed and robust statistics will be available.</p>

            <p eId="para_9268">Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness. It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested. To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions. </p>
            <p eId="para_9269"> Invalidity Pension is for people who are permanently incapable of work and is generally paid to pension age. To qualify for Invalidity Pension a person must have an incapacity for work of such a nature that the likelihood is that the claimant will be incapable of work for life, or an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim, and where the Deciding Officer or an Appeals Officer is satisfied that the claimant is likely to be unable to work for 1 year from the date of claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_9270"> Where a person with a disability wishes to return to work they may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).   PCB allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working. Participation on the PCB scheme is voluntary. A person who participates on the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_9271"> It is not intended to change the Invalidity Pension payment to remove the requirement to apply for Partial Capacity Benefit where persons wish to take up paid employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_9275">I propose to take Questions Nos. 536, 537 and 539 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9276"> My Department provides a range of activation supports to enable persons in receipt of a jobseeker's payment, including people who are also in part-time employment, to move to full-time employment with a sustainable income.  These supports include the JobPath Service, which was launched in July 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_9277"> JobPath provides an intensive personal service which focuses on the skills and experience of each person.  In the case of clients already in part-time employment this would, in the first instance, focus on any options to increase the level of employment in their current role.  If that is not possible the client would be encouraged to explore other opportunities including other full-time job opportunities with different employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9278"> To date, just over 195,000 clients have commenced their engagement period with the service . As of end October 2018, 24,185 clients who are working part-time have engaged with the service. </p>
            <p eId="para_9279"> At present, a full econometric evaluation of the service is being conducted in conjunction with the OECD.  The results of this econometric evaluation, which will provide detailed and robust statistics, will inform my Department's consideration of any future developments in this area. </p>

            <p eId="para_9281">The Department contracts for the provision of the local employment service (LES) with 22 local development/community companies. The LES have been engaged to deliver services to two client groups: unemployed jobseekers referred for activation by the Department and ‘other’ client groups, who attend the service voluntarily.  The ‘other’ client  group include people who have a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, non-Live Register returners (previously women returners), ex-offenders, members of the travelling community, long term unemployed (LTU) refugees and low income small holders.  </p>
            <p eId="para_9282"> In 2016, LES providers were asked to increase the frequency with which they engage with activation jobseekers to enhance the quality of the services they provide. To facilitate this more intensive engagement, the Department began to reduce the number of people referred to the LES so as to achieve and maintain a maximum caseload 120:1 per case officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_9283"> The LES were also requested to increase the time they allocate to work with each individual jobseeker and in 2017 set engagement patterns were introduced so that a LES case officer with 101-120 clients would be expected to have monthly meetings with the clients, 81-100 clients every three weeks and 80 or fewer client every two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_9284"> The following table below shows the number of activation clients and ‘other’ clients notified as commencing employment of 30+ hours per week in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018.</p>

            <p eId="para_9299">The negotiations on both the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship, both of which were endorsed by the European Council on 25 November, were conducted on behalf of the EU27 by the EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Commission's Article 50 Taskforce. </p>
            <p eId="para_9300"> Brexit is a priority issue for the Government, and a number of key decisions have been taken on measures to support East-West trade, that include staffing, ICT and infrastructure measures to implement checks and controls at our ports and borders. The Government also provided dedicated Brexit support measures in Budgets 2017, 2018, and 2019 to support businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_9301"> My key area of interest is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_9302">I met with the then UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the Right Honourable Esther McVey, on 23 April 2018. We agreed on our objective in ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the CTA, are safeguarded and maintained. </p>
            <p eId="para_9303"> I have a dedicated team in my Department which is conducting a deep analysis of scenarios on a scheme by scheme basis and contingency planning is on-going for all outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_9338">The Government’s primary strategy to tackle unemployment is to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. The economy is recovering strongly and will underpin employment growth and the availability of productive work for those on the Live Register. The Action Plan for Jobs sets out Ireland’s policies in support of enterprise and employment growth. The most recent Pathways to Work<b><i>
								</i></b>strategy, for the period 2016-2020, continues to focus on addressing long-term and youth unemployment by introducing new measures to ensure that the long-term and young unemployed take up a substantial share of the jobs being created by economic recovery. The strategy includes some additional actions, which are ongoing or have been completed, in relation to addressing long-term and youth unemployment:</p>
            <p eId="para_9339"> - the roll out of JobPath to engage more systematically with this group; the JobPath service has provided activation support to over 180,000 long term jobseekers since its inception in 2015. Jobseekers have benefitted from intensive engagement with a personal advisor to assist their return to employment. </p>
            <p eId="para_9340"> - targeted wage subsidies under JobsPlus, including JobsPlus Youth; </p>
            <p eId="para_9341"> - reserved places for the long term unemployed on employment and training programmes. (Latest available data indicates that approximately 55,000 people are availing of a range of activation programmes targeted primarily at the long term unemployed); </p>
            <p eId="para_9342"> - the continued provision of activation services to the long term unemployed by Local Employment Services and Jobclubs. In 2018, 26,000 customers have engaged with these services; and</p>
            <p eId="para_9343"> - the launch of the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment. YESS provides young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement, helping them to increase their employment prospects. </p>
            <p eId="para_9344"> Latest available data from the CSO Labour Force Survey shows that the number of persons recorded as working part-time, but underemployed, was 115,800 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 4.5% in year on year terms from the third quarter of 2017. This cohort currently represent approximately 4.8% of the total labour force (2.417m).</p>
            <p eId="para_9345"> Ireland’s Public Employment Service (PES) is managed by my Department and delivered directly by the Intreo service to provide a range of activation and employment support services to those who wish to avail of its services, on a walk-in basis. It is a priority of my Department to deliver the necessary supports and innovations to facilitate a fair chance to gain work, particularly full-time work, as more and more jobs become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_9346"> November 2018 saw a continued trend downwards in the number of people on the Live Register to 196,261 – representing a year on year decrease of 15.8% since November 2017, and a decrease of almost 30% over a two year period. </p>
            <p eId="para_9347"> On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Live Register total recorded a monthly decrease of 3,100 people (-1.5%) in November 2018, bringing the seasonally adjusted total to 207,200. The number on the seasonally adjusted Live Register in November 2018 is also the lowest number recorded since May 2008 (when it was 201,756).</p>
            <p eId="para_9348"> The Live Register trend for young people is similar, with the number of claimants aged 18-24 declining from 80,000 in 2011 to approximately 20,000 in November 2018. Since 2011, the month-on-month decline in Live Register numbers has been more rapid for the under 25 year cohort than for those over 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_9349"> Three out of five people on the Live Register are now classified as short term claimants. The number of long term claimants has decreased by almost 34% - to 80,557 – over a two year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_9350"> Many of those who have left the Live Register and returned to work will have been helped to do so by supports from my Department and the buoyant recovery created by government policy to reduce unemployment. </p>
            <p eId="para_9351"> This policy approach, and continuing economic recovery, will build on substantial improvements in the labour market that have been seen over the last few years.</p>

            <p eId="para_9722">As the Deputy is probably aware Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors are employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive public funding. They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants. My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors – it does not and has not provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_9723"> On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>
            <p eId="para_9724"> A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland. The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of €188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to €318 million. </p>
            <p eId="para_9725"> I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability. Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_9944"> Membership of the Council comprised of industry, trade union and policy experts appointed on the basis of their knowledge of labour market and employment policy.  The Council in particular focused on providing advice regarding the evaluation  of the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of measures implemented as part of the Pathways to Work strategy, and other relevant labour market policies aimed at supporting unemployed individuals to access employment.  It also provided policy advice on all matters concerning the delivery, engagement and awareness of employer supports in relation to the implementation of Pathways to Work, my Department’s Employer Engagement Strategy and other relevant labour market policies aimed at supporting unemployed individuals and other priority groups to access employment, while meeting the requirements of employers and the business community. </p>
            <p eId="para_9945"> Given the fact that unemployment is now at 5.3% the challenge faced by the Department is changing from primarily responding to unemployment to increasing participation. In this regard the Department continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to inform its approach to developing its public employment services, with an emphasis on maintaining a quality service not just to unemployed jobseekers but increasingly to other client groups of the Department, including people with disabilities.  For example, the Department as part of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, established a Make Work Pay Inter-Departmental Group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane comprising representatives from key Departments, agencies and three independent experts. This group reported in 2017 and its recommendations are now being followed up including via a consultative forum of key stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_9946"> Separately, the Minister for Education and Skills established the National Skills Council in April 2017. This council is charged with ensuring that Ireland can anticipate and respond to current, future and rapidly changing skills needs across all sectors in the labour market  while developing and retaining workplace talent.  Membership of the National Skills Council is, as was the case with the Labour Market Council, representative of the key stakeholders with interest in labour market developments. The Department is represented on this council.</p>
            <p eId="para_9947"> Against this background the Department is currently considering what consultative structures would be useful that will add value to its work in developing public employment services.</p>

            <p eId="para_9949">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, (CIB)  provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  </p>
            <p eId="para_9950"> The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  Specialist DMA advisors are working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped over 6,000 such borrowers. </p>
            <p eId="para_9951"> In 2018, over €2m has been allocated to CIB to fund the DMA service. Provision has been made for an allocation of €2.5 million for the DMA service as part of CIB's overall funding allocation for 2019 and this is expected to meet the costs of the service to the end of 2019. </p>

            <p eId="para_10018">The Christmas Bonus was paid last week to 1.2 million long-term social welfare beneficiaries, such as pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and long-term unemployed jobseekers, among others.  For the first time in 10 years, the Bonus was paid at 100%.  The Bonus is paid in recognition of the long-term financial dependence of these recipients on their weekly payment for all or most of their income.  </p>
            <p eId="para_10019"> Payment of the Bonus this year was based on the same eligibility requirements as in previous years.  Some payments, namely Jobseeker's Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Back to Education Allowance and Daily Expenses Allowance, have a duration requirement of 15 months in order to be eligible for the Bonus.  As in previous years, the Bonus is not paid to short-term schemes, such as Jobseeker's Benefit or Illness Benefit.  </p>
            <p eId="para_10020"> The following table sets out the information requested by the Deputy, including the estimated number of weekly social welfare recipients not entitled to the Bonus payment in December.  It should be noted that the table does not include monthly and annual payments that are not eligible for the Bonus, such as Child Benefit and Carer's Support Grant.</p>

Broughan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection</b> the estimated savings in each of the years 2009 to 2014, in tabular form, arising from the policy decision to reduce the jobseeker's allowance payments to young persons under 26 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_10153">An age-related reduced rate of €100 per week for Jobseeker's Allowance recipients was introduced in the Supplementary Budget in 2009 in respect of 18 and 19 year olds. Budget 2010 extended the €100 per week rate to 20 and 21 year olds and introduced a new €150 per week rate for 23 and 24 year olds.  Budget 2011 reduced the €150 per week rate to €144 per week and Budget 2014 extended the €144 per week rate to 25 year olds.</p>
            <p eId="para_10154"> In line with other EU and OECD jurisdictions where such measures feature in their social welfare systems, age-related reduced rates of jobseeker’s allowance for young unemployed people were introduced on a phased basis to tackle high youth unemployment. Receiving the maximum rate of JA without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to long-term welfare dependency from a young age. In this regard, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.3% in November 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_10155"> The age-related reduced rates are not applicable in certain circumstances, such as where the claimant has a qualified child, is participating in a recognised education or training course, transferred from Disability Allowance or where the person was formerly in State care.</p>
            <p eId="para_10156"> Age-related reduced rates apply to new entrants but not to existing recipients and the rates were also introduced at different times in the year (e.g. the 2009 Supplementary Budget measure took effect from the first week of May 2009).  Accordingly, in calculating estimated savings, certain assumptions are applied.  The estimated savings provided in this response are based on a combination of average Jobseeker’s Allowance recipient numbers in each of the years, estimated proportions of young jobseekers on age-related reduced rates and estimates of savings from the date the Budget measures were introduced.  In this regard, the estimated savings in each of the years 2009-2014 are set out in the following table, as requested by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_10187">Noise and visual amenity setback distances are the primary criteria in determining the minimum distance between a wind farm and the nearest residences. The current criteria in this regard are set out in the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines. My Department is currently undertaking a focused review of the 2006 Guidelines which, in addition to reviewing the noise and setback distance requirements, is also reviewing other key aspects including shadow flicker, community obligations on developers, community dividend and grid connections. </p>
            <p eId="para_10188"> As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>
            <p eId="para_10189"> SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in early 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid-2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_10190"> When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Pleanála must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p>

            <p eId="para_10194">I propose to take Questions Nos. 566, 567 and 575 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10195"> Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other urban centres are currently facing significant access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>
            <p eId="para_10196"> As laid out in the National Planning Framework, the Government is planning for an expected population increase of almost one million people by 2040. This growth will necessitate the delivery of some 500,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The State will be proactive in contributing to the delivery of the housing that we need by 2040 and cost rental will need to form a significant part of Ireland's housing system in the future. </p>
            <p eId="para_10197"> Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing very competitive European Investment Bank (EIB) financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes. Cost rental homes will be targeted at households earning low to moderate incomes up to a maximum of €50,000 for single applicants and €75,000 for dual applicants. </p>
            <p eId="para_10198"> Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting. There are two pilot cost rental schemes being advanced: one at Enniskerry Road, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and one at Emmet Road in Inchicore. It is expected that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site. While the final tenure-mix on the Emmet Road site will be decided by Dublin City Council and informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City Council under cost rental arrangements.  </p>
            <p eId="para_10199"> The tenders are currently being assessed for the Enniskerry Road Project, and it is anticipated that construction will commence in the first quarter of 2019. With regard to the Emmet Road site, while this project is at an earlier stage of development, Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive the project forward. In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating a special Consultative Forum specifically for this project. </p>
            <p eId="para_10200"> Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis, and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental framework in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot projects. The invaluable learning from these pathfinder projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites. My Department is also working with the European Investment Bank to leverage its advisory and research capacity so that broader international lessons on the operation of cost rental can inform Ireland's approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_10201"> With regard to the funding and financing arrangements, I have made it clear that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of these mixed-tenure developments. Indeed, part of the Emmet Road site has been identified as a “Housing with Support” demonstrator model under Rebuilding Ireland and will deliver 52 homes, due for completion in 2020. This element of the Emmet Road project has been approved for funding of circa €15 million under my Department’s Capital Assistance Scheme, with a contribution of €450,000 from the HSE/Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents. </p>
            <p eId="para_10202"> Furthermore, the Government has made €310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure to deliver affordable housing from its sites. The funding is available for cost rental projects and will contribute to reducing costs even further.  The terms of any loan funding arrangements put in place for individual projects will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_10203"> My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency and the new Land Development Agency to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale.</p>

            <p eId="para_10204">568. <b>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</b> asked the <b>Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government</b> his views on a recent ESRI report which indicates that the construction workforce here is too small to produce the level of social and affordable housing needed; if he has liaised with his ministerial colleagues in relation to the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government<recordedTime time="2018-12-11T00:35:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_10205">The recently published Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report on the construction industry indicates that much of the additional labour required for housing supply and other construction and infrastructural work may have to be secured through inward net migration.  However, the report concludes the Irish economy would not appear, at present, to be unduly constrained in terms of labour market. </p>
            <p eId="para_10206"> Increasing housing supply generally, and social and more affordable housing in particular, is, and will remain, a top Government priority. Through the continued delivery on the ambitious programme of action set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, the State intends to fully meet its obligations to those who need a home.</p>
            <p eId="para_10207"> Separately, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, continues to implement a range of measures  to ensure that there will be the required number of construction workers in place to support the delivery of the Rebuilding Ireland programme. These measures include:</p>
            <p eId="para_10208"> - educational and training programmes, which aim to develop the skills of apprentices in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market;</p>
            <p eId="para_10209"> - expanding the range of apprenticeships on  offer to meet the identified skills needs of industry; </p>
            <p eId="para_10210"> - SOLAS-funded construction related further education and  training programmes provided by Education and Training Boards;  and </p>
            <p eId="para_10211"> - working with the Construction Industry Federation, as industry lead, to further develop the national apprenticeship programme. </p>
            <p eId="para_10212"> Following the launch of the National Development Plan under Project Ireland 2040 in February 2018,  a Construction Sector Group (CSG) has been established. The role of the CSG is to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in relation to issues that may impact on the successful delivery of the NDP on a value-for-money basis for the State.  The CSG is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department will continue to participate actively in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_10217">I propose to take Questions Nos. 569 to 572, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10218"> While my Department does not have specific figures for the estimated cost of installing or converting the heating systems of social or affordable homes, the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for 2018 amendments to Part L of the Building Regulations in relation to dwellings, concerning homes irrespective of their tenure, set out some relevant information.</p>
            <p eId="para_10219"> The cost of replacement gas boilers, oil boilers and high heat retention electric storage heating for a small bungalow or semi-detached dwelling, as set out in the RIA, is as follows: Gas Boiler €1,973 - €2,390; Oil Boiler €3,215 - €3,633; high heat retention electric storage heating €3,215 to €3,633. The cost of an electric heat pump only, for a small bungalow or semi-detached dwelling, as set out in the RIA, is €8,899 to €10,082.</p>
            <p eId="para_10220"> When installing an electric heat pump in an existing dwelling, a fabric upgrade is required to reduce the heat demand and ensure the effective operation of the heating system. The estimated cost of a fabric upgrade combined with a heat pump, is in the order of €40,000 for a typical house. The cost of an electric heat pump on its own is approximately €10,000. The exact cost would depend on the age, size and construction of the dwelling being upgraded.</p>

            <p eId="para_10224">International research indicates that a retirement age of 55 is the optimum age to ensure that fire-fighters are capable of satisfactorily performing the tasks expected of them.  The retirement age of 55 years of age was introduced because of health and safety considerations related to the job. Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and underpinned by subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_10225"> A full time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p>
            <p eId="para_10226"> A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters. The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age. Following the report of the Expert Group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_10227"> In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established Industrial Relations processes. In this regard, the matter of increasing the retirement age for firefighters was included as part of recent discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU.</p>
            <p eId="para_10228"> I understand that these discussions are at a preliminary stage and therefore I am unable to give an indication as to when these discussions will be completed or the likely outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_10234">The Planning and Development (Amendment)(Fees) Regulations 2018 amend article 168 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to provide that the fee for making a submission or observation to a planning authority in respect of a planning application shall not be payable by a member of a local authority acting in his or her capacity as a member. This waiver does not extend to other public representatives. In this regard, local authority members join local authorities, prescribed bodies specified under article 28 of the 2001 Regulations, State authorities and trans-boundary States as persons / bodies that are not required the pay the €20 fee when making submissions / observations on planning applications. </p>
            <p eId="para_10235"> The recently enacted Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 gives legislative effect to a number of planning related recommendations of the Tribunal of Inquiry Into Certain Planning Matters and Payments.  During the progress of the 2018 Act through the Oireachtas, the consensus arrived at was that the implementation of the Tribunal planning related recommendations should be supplemented by the introduction of waived fee arrangements for the elected members of local authorities in respect of the making of observations or submissions on planning applications. </p>
            <p eId="para_10236"> In this regard, it was considered that the abolition of the €20 observation fee for elected members would enable them to participate in the planning process in a transparent way, but without undue expense, having regard to their role as democratically elected representatives for their areas.

            <p eId="para_10238">The Mortgage to Rent (MTR) scheme introduced in 2012 is targeted at those households in mortgage arrears who have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable by their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), who agree to the voluntary surrender of their home and who have very limited options, if any, to meet their long-term housing needs themselves. In addition, the household must be deemed eligible for social housing support and the property must meet certain eligibility criteria.  </p>
            <p eId="para_10239"> I am not in a position to comment on any particular case nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.  The reasons why a case may not have progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the financial viability of the purchase of the property by an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  The decision to purchase a property under the MTR scheme must make commercial sense  for an AHB.  I cannot compel any AHB to purchase a particular property at a particular price nor can I compel a lender to sell a particular property at a particular price.   Where MTR is not an option, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10240"> The Abhaile service, formally launched by the Government in 2016, is a national mortgage arrears resolution service, provided free of charge to the borrower and its aim is to help mortgage holders in arrears to find the best solutions and keep them, wherever possible, in their own homes.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.  The Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS) acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie/abhaile</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_10246">The Planning &amp; Development (Amendment) Act 2018 provides the statutory footing for the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.

Interim premises have been sourced in Sir John Rogerson's Quay in Dublin, pending a decision on a permanent location for the Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_10250">The Abhaile Project was the winner of the Homes for Smart Ageing Universal Design Challenge in June 2017. The project developed an innovative new model to support older homeowners to reconfigure their family-sized homes by creating an independent living area suitable for the older homeowner, eliminating the need to use the stairs; and creating an affordable one-bedroom rental home upstairs. I understand that the promoters of the project are currently involved in two projects to bring the project to different house-types, one in Clondalkin and a second in Castleknock, and I will be interested to learn how these projects progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_10251"> My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, is currently exploring policy options including supporting housing/housing with care so that older people have a wider range of housing options and choices available to them.  There are a number of key principles underpinning Government policy on housing for older people and on which the policy framework will be constructed. These involve putting in place measures to ensure that sustainable housing is provided in the right location to enable people to age in the community; to design housing and the built environment in accordance with the principles of sustainable lifetime housing; to promote the use of assistive technology to support people to live independently; to give adequate consideration to the need for social connectedness in devising policy; and to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to achieve the policy objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_10252"> At an Expert Conference on Housing for Older People in Farmleigh on 20 November, 2018, a number of experts in the field, including the Abhaile Project, explained how these principles can be brought to fruition in imaginative and practical ways, which bring about tangible benefits for the older person. I will ensure that this invaluable knowledge is integrated into the development of policy in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_10253"> The final policy framework will be published early next year and this will be a further step in the broader process of seeking to ensure that older people are provided with appropriate accommodation options that are suited to their needs. The policy statement will set out a framework by which the Government can facilitate housing, including housing with care, for older people having regard to current demographics and looking at best practice models. The aim is to ensure that people can grow old and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence.</p>

            <p eId="para_10362">At its meeting last week, the Government reviewed the progress on Bills to amend the Constitution and decided that, subject to passage of the necessary Constitution Amendment Bills, two referendums will be held on the same day as the local and European elections in May 2019.   Work is being progressed in my Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to inform the development of an appropriate Constitution Amendment Bill in good time for the holding of a referendum on extending the franchise at Presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The second referendum to be held in tandem with the local and European elections will be on divorce which will be a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_10363"> The Government noted that further consideration will be given to the timing of a referendum on reducing the voting age to 16.  However, it is not proposed that this referendum be held in 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_10364"> In addition, the Government noted all proposals for referendums contained in Private Members’ Bills, in particular the Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) Bill (No.2) 2016 which is now at Committee stage.  On 20 November 2018, the Government approved the priority drafting of amendments to be made to this Bill, with work currently on-going.  These amendments are to focus on retaining the entity charged with the provision of public water services in public ownership.  It is intended that the draft wording arising, once finalised, will be brought back to Government for approval and can then be brought forward as a proposed amendment to the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_10423">Under Action 18 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector, a Working Group was established, involving representatives of all major public stakeholders with a policy interest in short-term lettings, to develop guidance in relation to planning applications, changes of use relating to short-term lettings and to examine the need for new regulatory arrangements.  Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_10424"> Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I recently announced plans to introduce a “one host, one home” model in areas where there is high housing demand. </p>
            <p eId="para_10425"> Homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person’s primary residence. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or</p>
            <p eId="para_10426"> limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_10427"> Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_10428"> These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>
            <p eId="para_10429"> It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_10432"> In relation to the building mentioned by the Deputy, I am aware of the decision by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to dispose of the building. While the sale is a matter for the OPW, and I have no function as Minister, I do understand and appreciate the value such a building would have, particularly to those for whom it has an historic association.</p>
            <p eId="para_10433"> The Planning and Development Acts give primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect our architectural heritage by including particular structures on their Record of Protected Structures (RPS).  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  As the Deputy may be aware, the building mentioned is not on the RPS. Ultimately, the decision as to inclusion of a building or structure on the RPS remains a reserved function of the planning authority, in this case Dublin City Council. </p>
            <p eId="para_10434"> The primary function of the National Monuments Acts is to record and protect ancient sites and features.  The focus of the Acts is on archaeological remains and traces and does not generally extend to more modern buildings and structures. Accordingly, while the Model School is undoubtedly of local interest and importance, it is not included in, nor would it be appropriate for inclusion in, the statutory Record of Monuments and Places maintained by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_10440"> Brexit is a priority issue for this Government, and the Taoiseach, my cabinet colleagues and I have taken every opportunity to engage with EU partners and the UK to advance Ireland’s priorities. Earlier this year as part of my visit to London in connection with the GB 18 Programme in March I met with  Matt Hancock MP, the then UK Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  I also met with Fiona Hyslop MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs in the course of my visit to Glasgow in February in connection with GB18.   At both of these meetings Brexit related matters were discussed in addition to other matters of mutual interest.</p>
